This file details several distinct development tasks and their associated considerations:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:** This is the most extensive section, outlining an algorithm for detecting "bursts" of notifications. It employs a deque (`deque`) to store recent notification timestamps and uses parameters `T` (time threshold) and `C` (notification count threshold) to determine if a burst has occurred. A `boolean isSpecialNotificationShown` flag is used to ensure a special notification is displayed only once per burst, with logic for resetting this flag. The section includes detailed steps on how notifications are added and removed from the deque, how burst conditions are checked (`T3 - T0 < T`), and examples with specific timestamp values (`T0`, `T5`, `T13`, etc.) to illustrate the logic and confirm adherence to acceptance criteria.

    Following the core logic, there's a comprehensive list of **"Todo / suggestions"** related to this feature. These include:
    *   Controlling the frequency and visual aspects (ID, position, icon, title, click events) of special notifications.
    *   Testing considerations (double account IDs, automation).
    *   Technical improvements (replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list, refining deque reset logic, injecting Gson).
    *   ViewModel integration (add setters/getters).
    *   Component renaming (`NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`).

2.  **Miscellaneous Development Notes:**
    *   A pending commit to replace `.png` image assets with `.svg` equivalents.
    *   A note on handling device rotation within "MDM Browser Config."

3.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:** This section outlines the logic for managing when an app review prompt is shown to users. The core mechanism involves a counter that:
    *   Resets for 90 days after the prompt is shown.
    *   Starts incrementing again after the 90-day period.
    *   Keeps incrementing if the prompt has not yet been shown.

    Similar to the notification burst, there are **"App Review TODO"** items and **"Questions"** (both answered and unanswered). Key points include:
    *   Tasks to test existing app review code and refactor `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   Answered questions confirm that assets are valid for changes/closing tickets, agents can create tickets, refactoring should be in a separate PR, and user on-call status is not needed (increment when `ShiftEventActivity` is opened).
    *   It specifies using shared preferences for counters, avoiding account-wise or unique counts, and moving prompt display logic from `HomeActivity` to `AppReviewManager` for broader applicability.
    *   Further to-dos involve immediate prompt display on the trigger page, avoiding increments for browser-based solution articles, and conditions for "seen" events.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Detailed Algorithmic Descriptions:** The log provides a step-by-step breakdown of complex logic (notification bursts, app review prompt conditions) rather than just high-level descriptions.
*   **"Todo / suggestions" and "Questions" Sections:** Both major features (Notification Burst and App Review) conclude with comprehensive lists of future work, design considerations, and open/closed questions, indicating an ongoing development and grooming process.
*   **Parameter-Driven Logic:** Both the notification burst (using `T` and `C`) and app review prompt (using `90 days`) rely on configurable or hardcoded parameters to control their behavior.
*   **State Management:** Explicit use of flags (e.g., `isSpecialNotificationShown`) and counters to manage the state and trigger conditions for features.
*   **Focus on UI/UX Impact:** Considerations for how notifications appear (position, icon, title, click events) and when prompts are shown (immediate display, specific screens) are prominent.
*   **Refactoring and Technical Debt Awareness:** Mentions of refactoring, separating PRs, and potential technical improvements (e.g., Gson injection, replacing PNGs with SVGs) indicate a focus on code quality and maintainability.
