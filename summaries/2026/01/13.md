# Activity Summary for 1/13/2026

## 1:54:49 PM
The log, timestamped 1/9/2026, 2:05:46 PM, details development work primarily within a file referred to as "Untitled-3," focusing on two main features: "Notification Burst" logic and an "App review and Rating Prompt."

**Notification Burst Grooming (`Untitled-3`):**
This section outlines the logic for detecting a "burst" of notifications. It uses a `deque` (doubly-ended queue) to store recent notifications, checking if `C` notifications are received within a `T` time threshold.
*   **Core Logic:** Notifications are pushed to the front of the `deque`. When the `deque` reaches capacity `C`, new notifications are compared against the oldest one (`deque[0]`) to determine if `T(new) - T(old) < T`. If true, it's a burst, and a `isSpecialNotificationShown` flag prevents repetitive special notifications. If the time threshold is exceeded, the `deque` is cleared, and `isSpecialNotificationShown` is reset.
*   **Parameters:** `T` (time threshold, e.g., 15) and `C` (notification count, e.g., 3) define a burst.
*   **Examples:** Detailed walkthroughs demonstrate how notifications (`T0`, `T5`, `T13`, `T14`, `T28`) are handled, illustrating scenarios where a burst is detected or not.
*   **Todo/Suggestions:** Numerous follow-up tasks are identified, including:
    *   Allowing special notifications to show more than once.
    *   Defining notification ID and position for special notifications.
    *   Testing for double account IDs and automating notifications.
    *   Replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list (deque).
    *   Refining deque reset logic.
    *   Exploring Gson injection in `NotificationBurstConverter`.
    *   Customizing special notification titles (with account name), group attachment, and icons.
    *   Adding click events to special notifications.
    *   Adding setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`.
    *   Potentially renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

**App Review and Rating Prompt (`Untitled-3`):**
This feature defines rules for showing an app review prompt.
*   **Logic:** The prompt's counter should reset after it's shown and not increment for the subsequent 90 days. After 90 days, incrementing resumes. If the prompt hasn't been shown, the counter should keep incrementing.
*   **Todo:** Test the existing app review code, refactor `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
*   **Resolved Questions:** Decisions include: not needing a separate module, fixing duplicate API calls for update tasks (implicit 'yes' for fixing), adding assets to tickets (yes, even for changes/closing), allowing agents to create tickets (fine), ignoring "different" detection, accepting data loss on uninstall, creating a separate PR for refactoring (yes), incrementing when `ShiftEventActivity` is opened for on-call detection (no need for specific "oncall" recognition), keeping the prompt persona-independent, using shared preferences without account-wise counts, and moving the prompt logic to `AppReviewManager` to show it on any screen.
*   **Pending App Review Tasks:** Show the prompt immediately when conditions are met on a page, prevent incrementing for browser cases in solution articles, and show the prompt for "seen" events (details incomplete).

**Other Changes/Tasks (`Untitled-3`):**
*   A commit to "Replace png with svg" is mentioned as not yet pushed.
*   A brief mention of "MDM Browser Config - handle rotation" indicates a separate task.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**
*   A recurring pattern of "Todo / suggestions" and "Questions" highlights ongoing development, refactoring needs, and decision-making.
*   The use of descriptive variable names like `isSpecialNotificationShown` and `deque` suggests a focus on clear, maintainable code.
*   The detailed examples for notification burst logic demonstrate a thorough approach to edge cases and system behavior.
*   The discussions around app review highlight user experience and timing considerations.
