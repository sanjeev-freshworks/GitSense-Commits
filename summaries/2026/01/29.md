# Activity Summary for 1/29/2026

## 9:06:39 AM
The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json` file was logged twice within a short interval on 1/26/2026, specifically at 1:15:53 PM and 1:16:00 PM. The content of the file remained identical across both timestamps.

The `launch.json` file configures VS Code debugging for a Flutter project. It defines three primary launch configurations:
1.  **"FS Module Dev"**: Configured to launch the `fsmodule` application's development version (`lib/main_dev.dart`), using `../../config/dev_config.json` for Dart defines.
2.  **"FS Sdk Dev"**: Configured to launch the `fs_sdk` application's main entry point (`lib/main.dart`), also utilizing `../../config/dev_config.json` and explicitly setting the `environment=development` Dart define.
3.  **"Golden"**: A configuration for running golden tests, including the `--update-goldens` argument and setting `isTesting=true`.

A recurring pattern in these configurations is the use of `dart-define-from-file` for external configuration and `--dart-define` for passing specific environment variables or flags, commonly seen in Flutter development workflows for managing different environments and testing scenarios. The timestamps suggest a rapid sequence of saves without any functional changes to the file's content.
