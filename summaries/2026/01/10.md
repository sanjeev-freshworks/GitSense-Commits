# Activity Summary for 1/10/2026

## 1:52:53 PM
The file `Untitled-3`, timestamped 1/9/2026, 2:05:46 PM, details development notes and open questions for two primary features: Notification Burst detection and an App Review and Rating Prompt.

**Notification Burst Feature:**
This section outlines the logic for identifying and managing "burst" notifications, defined as `C` notifications received within `T` time.
*   **Core Logic:** It proposes using a deque (`back[]front`) to store notification timestamps. New notifications are added to the front, and older ones are removed from the back once the deque reaches capacity `C`.
*   **Special Notification:** A `bool isSpecialNotificationShown` flag is used to ensure a special notification is displayed only once per burst, with subsequent burst notifications either discarded or handled without re-showing the special notification.
*   **Conditions:** The logic details how to differentiate between a normal notification, a burst notification (when `current_timestamp - oldest_timestamp < T`), and a non-burst notification if the time threshold `T` is exceeded. When `T` is exceeded, the deque is cleared, and `isSpecialNotificationShown` is reset.
*   **Examples:** Concrete values like `T = 15` and `C = 3` are provided with timestamp examples to illustrate the burst detection mechanism.
*   **Follow-up/Suggestions:** A comprehensive list of "Todo / suggestions" indicates areas for further development, including: controlling special notification frequency and position, handling notification IDs and icons, testing for double account IDs, automating notifications, refining deque reset logic, injecting `gson`, displaying account names, adding click events, utilizing notification counts, and adding getters/setters in `ListNotificationViewModel`. A suggestion to rename `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem` is also noted.

**App Review and Rating Prompt:**
This section focuses on the behavior and implementation challenges of an app review prompt.
*   **Prompt Logic:** The prompt's display mechanism dictates that once shown, a counter should be reset for 90 days, during which no further increments occur. After this 90-day period, the counter resumes incrementing. If the prompt has not been shown, the counter continuously increments.
*   **TODOs:** Key tasks include testing the current app review code, refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`, ensuring the prompt shows immediately on achievement of logic, preventing increment for browser cases in solution articles, and addressing "seen" events.
*   **Questions:** Several "Unanswered" questions cover architectural decisions (separate module vs. core module), fixing duplicate API calls (`update tasks api`), and specific use cases like ticket management and "different" detection. "Answered" questions clarify aspects like asset validity for tickets, agent's ability to create tickets, data loss on uninstall (acceptable), separate PR for refactoring (yes), detecting "oncall" users (not needed), using shared preferences (no account-wise counts), and moving prompt logic to `AppReviewManager`.

**Other Minor Mentions:**
*   A brief note about "MDM Browser Config - handle rotation" is present.
*   A pending commit to "Replace png with svg" is mentioned.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Active Development & Grooming:** The log reads like a detailed grooming session or ongoing development notes, with clear feature descriptions followed by extensive lists of "Todo / suggestions" and "Questions," indicating an iterative development process.
*   **User Experience Focus:** Both main features (notifications and app review) directly address user interaction and experience within the application.
*   **State Management:** There's a strong emphasis on managing state through flags (`isSpecialNotificationShown`), data structures (deque), and explicit reset conditions.
*   **Time-Sensitive Logic:** Both features heavily rely on time-based calculations (burst within `T` time, app review prompt cooldown of 90 days).
*   **Code Quality & Architecture Concerns:** Discussions around refactoring, module structure, and dependency injection suggest an ongoing effort to maintain a robust and scalable codebase.

The provided log details changes within a file named `Untitled-3`, with the sole timestamp recorded as `1/9/2026, 2:05:46 PM`. The content focuses on two primary features: Notification Burst detection and an App Review and Rating Prompt.

**File: Untitled-3**
**Timestamp: 1/9/2026, 2:05:46 PM**

**Key Updates:**

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:**
    *   A detailed conceptual outline for detecting a "burst" of notifications using a deque data structure (`push_front` and `pop_back`).
    *   The core logic involves tracking `C` notifications within a `T` time threshold.
    *   A boolean flag, `isSpecialNotificationShown`, controls the display of a special notification when a burst is detected, and it includes logic for discarding subsequent notifications within the burst.
    *   Extensive examples are provided with `T=15` and `C=3` to illustrate the burst detection mechanism and how different incoming timestamps (`T0, T5, T13, T14, T28`) would be handled, emphasizing comparison with the oldest element in the deque.
    *   **Todo/Suggestions:** A significant list of proposed enhancements and considerations for the special notification feature, including showing it multiple times, managing notification IDs and positions, testing with double account IDs, automation, refactoring notification time tracking (`prevNotificationTime` to a list), logic for resetting the deque, injecting `gson`, displaying account names/icons, adding click events, utilizing notification counts, and adding setters/getters to `ListNotificationViewModel`. A suggestion to rename `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem` is also present.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:**
    *   Outlines the logic for displaying an app review prompt based on a counter system.
    *   The counter should reset and not increment for 90 days after the prompt is shown.
    *   It should increment when the prompt is not yet shown or after the 90-day period expires.
    *   **TODOs:** Key action items include testing the existing app review code, and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   **Questions & Answers:** A section detailing discussions and decisions on various aspects, such as module placement (keeping in core), handling duplicate API calls (fix needed), asset validity, agent ticket creation (allowed), "different" detection (not needed), data loss on uninstall (acceptable), PR strategy for refactoring (separate PR recommended), on-call detection (not needed, just increment when `ShiftEventActivity` is opened), persona independence, and using shared preferences (not account-wise).
    *   **Specific TODOs:** Immediately showing the prompt where the logic condition is met, not incrementing for browser cases in solution articles, and showing the prompt for "seen" events.

3.  **Other Mentions:**
    *   A note about replacing PNG images with SVG (commit not yet pushed).
    *   A brief mention of handling rotation for MDM Browser Config.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Deque Usage:** The `deque` data structure is central to the notification burst logic for maintaining a sliding window of recent notification timestamps.
*   **Counter/Time-gated Logic:** Both the notification burst (C notifications within T time) and the app review prompt (90-day reset) rely on counter and time-based conditions for triggering actions.
*   **Detailed Planning and Discussion:** The presence of extensive "Todo/suggestions" and "Questions (Unanswered/Answered)" sections indicates an active development and planning phase, where implementation details, edge cases, and architectural choices are being thoroughly considered and documented within the code log itself.
*   **Flag-based State Management:** The `isSpecialNotificationShown` boolean flag is used to manage the state and behavior of the special notification.
