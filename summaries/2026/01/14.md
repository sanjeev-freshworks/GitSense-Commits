# Activity Summary for 1/14/2026

## 2:09:30 PM
The provided log, timestamped **1/9/2026, 2:05:46 PM**, details changes and ideas within a file named `Untitled-3`, covering several distinct areas of development:

**Notification Burst Detection:**
A core section outlines a notification burst detection algorithm using a deque (doubly-ended queue). The system aims to identify when `C` notifications are received within a `T` time threshold.
*   **Logic:** Notifications are pushed to the front of the deque. If the deque reaches `C` length and the time difference between the current notification and the oldest one in the deque (`T_current - T_oldest`) is less than `T`, it's considered a burst.
*   **Special Notification:** A `bool isSpecialNotificationShown` flag manages the display of a special notification, ensuring it's shown only once per burst or when conditions are met.
*   **Resetting:** If the time threshold is exceeded, the deque is cleared, and `isSpecialNotificationShown` is reset.
*   **Examples:** Detailed examples with `T = 15, C = 3` are provided, walking through various notification arrival times (`T0, T5, T13, T14, T28`) to illustrate the burst detection and special notification logic.
*   **Suggestions/Todos:** Numerous follow-up tasks are listed, including controlling special notification display frequency and position, integrating with specific components like `ListNotificationViewModel`, handling account IDs, and potential renaming of related classes.

**App Review and Rating Prompt:**
The log describes a logic for managing an in-app review and rating prompt:
*   **Counter Management:** When the prompt is shown, a counter should reset and not increment for the next 90 days. After 90 days, incrementing resumes. If the prompt hasn't been shown, the counter keeps incrementing.
*   **TODOs:** Tasks include testing the existing app review code, refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`, immediately showing the prompt when conditions are met on a page, and avoiding increments for browser cases in solution articles.
*   **Questions:** Several design and implementation questions are addressed:
    *   A separate module for app review is not strictly required.
    *   The `update tasks api` being called twice is acknowledged as a potential fix.
    *   Confirmations on asset validity for ticket changes/closings and agent ticket creation.
    *   Guidance on handling "different" (don't detect), data loss on uninstall (acceptable).
    *   Confirmation that refactoring should be a separate PR.
    *   No need to identify "oncall" users; the counter increments when `ShiftEventActivity` is opened, using shared preferences without account-specific counts.
    *   The prompt should be shown on any screen where conditions are met, suggesting moving logic from `HomeActivity` to `AppReviewManager`.

**Miscellaneous:**
*   A brief mention of a pending branch for replacing `png` with `svg`.
*   A note on handling rotation for "MDM Browser Config."

**Recurring Elements:**
The log demonstrates a structured approach to development, with clear separation of feature logic (notification burst, app review), associated tasks/suggestions, and answered/unanswered questions. It frequently references mobile application specific components like `deque`, `gson`, `room db`, `R.string`, `ListNotificationViewModel`, `AppReviewManager`, `AppStore`, `HomeActivity`, and `ShiftEventActivity`, indicating development within an Android environment. There's a strong focus on user experience through controlled notifications and timely app review prompts.
