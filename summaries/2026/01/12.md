# Activity Summary for 1/12/2026

## 3:43:46 AM
The `Untitled-3` log, timestamped `1/9/2026, 2:05:46 PM`, details conceptual design, pseudo-code, and extensive to-do lists for several features.

The primary focus is on **Notification Burst Grooming**, outlining a mechanism to detect and handle bursts of notifications. This involves using a deque (doubly-ended queue) to store recent notification timestamps, specifically `T0, T1, T2, ...`, and a boolean flag `isSpecialNotificationShown`. A burst is identified if `C` notifications are received within `T` time. The pseudo-code details the logic for pushing/popping elements from the deque, comparing notification times (`T3 - T0 < T`), and conditionally showing a special notification, discarding subsequent notifications, or resetting the burst state. Example scenarios with specific time values (`T=15, C=3`) are provided to illustrate the logic.

A comprehensive list of **Todo/Suggestions** related to the notification burst feature is included:
*   Controlling special notification display (multiple times, ID, position, icon, title with account name).
*   Testing for double account IDs and automating notifications.
*   Refining deque reset logic and potential injection of `gson`.
*   Adding setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`.
*   Considering renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

Another significant section covers the **App Review and Rating Prompt**. The design outlines conditions for showing the prompt, including resetting a counter for 90 days after it's shown, and incrementing it otherwise. **App Review TODOs** include testing the current code, refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.

A **Questions** section is divided into `Unanswered` and `Answered` items.
*   `Unanswered` questions touch upon module separation for new features and whether a twice-called API (`update tasks api`) should be fixed.
*   `Answered` questions address asset validity for ticket changes, agent ticket creation, data loss on uninstall, Github PR strategy for refactoring (recommended separate PR), and the implementation of on-call detection (just increment when `ShiftEventActivity` is opened, use shared preferences, persona independent).

Recurring elements across the log include:
*   The use of `T` (time) and `C` (count) thresholds for event triggering.
*   Detailed pseudo-code examples to clarify complex logic.
*   Extensive task lists and Q&A sections, indicating an ongoing design and development phase.
*   Mentions of UI/UX considerations like notification icons, positions, and click events.
*   A brief note about replacing PNGs with SVGs and handling MDM Browser Config rotation.
