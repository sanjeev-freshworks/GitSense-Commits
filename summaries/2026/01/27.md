# Activity Summary for 1/27/2026

## 1:40:50 PM
The `launch.json` file, located at `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json`, was recorded twice on 1/26/2026, at 1:15:53 PM and 1:16:00 PM. Crucially, the content of the file remained identical across both timestamps, indicating no actual code changes occurred within this 7-second interval.

The file configures VS Code launch settings for a Flutter project, defining three distinct configurations:

*   **FS Module Dev:** Configured to launch the `fsmodule` application in debug mode, targeting `lib/main_dev.dart`, and loading development-specific settings from `../../config/dev_config.json`.
*   **FS Sdk Dev:** Configured to launch the `fs_sdk` application in debug mode, targeting `lib/main.dart`, also loading `../../config/dev_config.json`, and explicitly setting a `environment=development` Dart define.
*   **Golden:** Designed for running Dart tests, specifically for updating golden test files, and sets a `isTesting=true` Dart define.

A recurring pattern across these configurations is their `type: dart` and `request: launch` properties, and the consistent use of `codeLens` for various run/debug actions, making them easily accessible within the editor. Both development configurations rely on a shared `dev_config.json` for environment-specific settings.
