# Activity Summary for 1/26/2026

## 2:22:25 PM
The provided log primarily focuses on a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json`.

The file was logged at two very close timestamps: 1/26/2026, 1:15:53 PM and 1/26/2026, 1:16:00 PM. Despite the two entries, the content of the `launch.json` file remained identical across both timestamps, indicating no actual code changes were introduced or persisted between these log entries.

The `launch.json` file defines Visual Studio Code debug configurations for a Flutter project. It includes three distinct configurations:

1.  **"FS Module Dev"**: Configured to launch a Flutter application located at `${workspaceFolder}/apps/fsmodule`, specifically `lib/main_dev.dart`. It passes arguments to load development configurations from `../../config/dev_config.json`.
2.  **"FS Sdk Dev"**: Configured to launch another Flutter application at `${workspaceFolder}/apps/fs_sdk`, using `lib/main.dart`. Similar to "FS Module Dev", it loads development configurations from `../../config/dev_config.json` and additionally defines an `environment=development` dart-define.
3.  **"Golden"**: This configuration is set up for running Golden tests, with arguments `--update-goldens` and `--dart-define=isTesting=true`.

A recurring pattern across the "FS Module Dev" and "FS Sdk Dev" configurations is their use of `flutterMode: "debug"` and the `args` property to load application-specific configurations using `--dart-define-from-file=../../config/dev_config.json`. The "Golden" configuration specifically targets test execution. All configurations utilize `type: "dart"` for launching.
