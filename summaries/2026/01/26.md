# Activity Summary for 1/26/2026

## 2:22:25 PM
The provided log primarily focuses on a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json`.

The file was logged at two very close timestamps: 1/26/2026, 1:15:53 PM and 1/26/2026, 1:16:00 PM. Despite the two entries, the content of the `launch.json` file remained identical across both timestamps, indicating no actual code changes were introduced or persisted between these log entries.

The `launch.json` file defines Visual Studio Code debug configurations for a Flutter project. It includes three distinct configurations:

1.  **"FS Module Dev"**: Configured to launch a Flutter application located at `${workspaceFolder}/apps/fsmodule`, specifically `lib/main_dev.dart`. It passes arguments to load development configurations from `../../config/dev_config.json`.
2.  **"FS Sdk Dev"**: Configured to launch another Flutter application at `${workspaceFolder}/apps/fs_sdk`, using `lib/main.dart`. Similar to "FS Module Dev", it loads development configurations from `../../config/dev_config.json` and additionally defines an `environment=development` dart-define.
3.  **"Golden"**: This configuration is set up for running Golden tests, with arguments `--update-goldens` and `--dart-define=isTesting=true`.

A recurring pattern across the "FS Module Dev" and "FS Sdk Dev" configurations is their use of `flutterMode: "debug"` and the `args` property to load application-specific configurations using `--dart-define-from-file=../../config/dev_config.json`. The "Golden" configuration specifically targets test execution. All configurations utilize `type: "dart"` for launching.

The log details changes to a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json`. Two entries for this file were recorded on January 26, 2026, at 1:15:53 PM and 1:16:00 PM.

Despite the two separate timestamps, the content of the `launch.json` file remained identical across both logged entries, indicating no functional modifications were introduced between these specific timestamps.

The `launch.json` file configures Visual Studio Code debug settings for a Flutter project. Key configurations include:
*   **"FS Module Dev"**: Designed for launching the `fsmodule` application in debug mode, specifically targeting `lib/main_dev.dart` and utilizing `../../config/dev_config.json` for environment definitions.
*   **"FS Sdk Dev"**: Configured to launch the `fs_sdk` application in debug mode using `lib/main.dart`, also sourcing environment variables from `../../config/dev_config.json` and explicitly defining `environment=development`.
*   **"Golden"**: A dedicated configuration for running or debugging golden tests, which includes arguments like `--update-goldens` and sets `isTesting=true`.

A consistent pattern across these configurations is the use of `flutterMode: "debug"` for the application launches and specific `codeLens` titles (e.g., `(dev)` for development builds, `(golden)` for golden tests) to indicate their purpose within the VS Code UI. Both development configurations reference `dev_config.json` and are set up to launch specific `main` files for their respective applications.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json` file was logged at two very close timestamps: `1/26/2026, 1:15:53 PM` and `1/26/2026, 1:16:00 PM`. Both log entries show identical content, indicating that no functional changes were introduced between these two saves, or it might have been a re-save without modification.

The file configures VS Code debug launch profiles for a Flutter project, defining three distinct configurations:

1.  **FS Module Dev**:
    *   Launches the `apps/fsmodule` application using `lib/main_dev.dart`.
    *   Passes `../../config/dev_config.json` via `--dart-define-from-file` for development-specific configurations.
    *   Sets `flutterMode` to `"debug"`.

2.  **FS Sdk Dev**:
    *   Launches the `apps/fs_sdk` application using `lib/main.dart`.
    *   Similar to `FS Module Dev`, it uses `../../config/dev_config.json` via `--dart-define-from-file`.
    *   Additionally defines `environment=development` using `--dart-define`.
    *   Sets `flutterMode` to `"debug"`.

3.  **Golden**:
    *   A configuration specifically for running golden tests.
    *   Includes arguments `--update-goldens` and `--dart-define=isTesting=true`, indicating its use in updating or running test snapshots.

A recurring pattern across the development configurations is the use of `dart-define-from-file` to load development-specific configurations from a shared `dev_config.json` and the explicit setting of `flutterMode: "debug"`. All configurations also utilize `codeLens` for convenient in-editor run/debug options.
