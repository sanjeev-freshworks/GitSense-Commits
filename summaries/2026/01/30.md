# Activity Summary for 1/30/2026

## 1:36:23 PM
The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json` was recorded twice in quick succession on 1/26/2026, first at 1:15:53 PM and again at 1:16:00 PM. The content of the file is identical across both timestamps, indicating no functional change was introduced in this file between these two log entries.

The `launch.json` file configures VS Code debug profiles for a Flutter project. It defines three primary launch configurations:
*   **"FS Module Dev"**: Configured to launch `lib/main_dev.dart` within the `apps/fsmodule` directory, utilizing `dev_config.json` for environment definitions.
*   **"FS Sdk Dev"**: Configured to launch `lib/main.dart` within the `apps/fs_sdk` directory, also using `dev_config.json` and explicitly setting `environment=development`.
*   **"Golden"**: Designed for running Golden tests, including arguments to `--update-goldens` and define `isTesting=true`.

A recurring pattern is the use of `flutterMode: "debug"` for the development configurations and the inclusion of `codeLens` definitions for convenient launching from the editor. Both development configurations rely on `dev_config.json` for configuration details.
