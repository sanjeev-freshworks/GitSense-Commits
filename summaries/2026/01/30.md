# Activity Summary for 1/30/2026

## 1:36:23 PM
The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json` was recorded twice in quick succession on 1/26/2026, first at 1:15:53 PM and again at 1:16:00 PM. The content of the file is identical across both timestamps, indicating no functional change was introduced in this file between these two log entries.

The `launch.json` file configures VS Code debug profiles for a Flutter project. It defines three primary launch configurations:
*   **"FS Module Dev"**: Configured to launch `lib/main_dev.dart` within the `apps/fsmodule` directory, utilizing `dev_config.json` for environment definitions.
*   **"FS Sdk Dev"**: Configured to launch `lib/main.dart` within the `apps/fs_sdk` directory, also using `dev_config.json` and explicitly setting `environment=development`.
*   **"Golden"**: Designed for running Golden tests, including arguments to `--update-goldens` and define `isTesting=true`.

A recurring pattern is the use of `flutterMode: "debug"` for the development configurations and the inclusion of `codeLens` definitions for convenient launching from the editor. Both development configurations rely on `dev_config.json` for configuration details.

The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json`.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The file `launch.json` defines Visual Studio Code launch configurations for a Flutter project. It contains three distinct configurations:

1.  **"FS Module Dev"**: Configured to launch the `fsmodule` application in debug mode, specifically running `lib/main_dev.dart`. It passes arguments to load development-specific configurations from `../../config/dev_config.json`.
2.  **"FS Sdk Dev"**: Configured to launch the `fs_sdk` application in debug mode, running `lib/main.dart`. Similar to "FS Module Dev", it loads `../../config/dev_config.json` and additionally sets a `--dart-define=environment=development` argument.
3.  **"Golden"**: This configuration is designed for running and debugging golden tests. It includes arguments `--update-goldens` (likely to update reference images for golden tests) and `--dart-define=isTesting=true`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The log records two timestamps for this file: 1/26/2026, 1:15:53 PM and 1/26/2026, 1:16:00 PM. Crucially, the content of the `launch.json` file is identical in both entries, indicating that no functional code change occurred between these two very close timestamps. It appears to be a record of the file being saved or touched without modification.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
A recurring pattern across the "Dev" configurations is the use of `args` to pass `--dart-define-from-file=../../config/dev_config.json`, centralizing the loading of development environment settings. Both also utilize `flutterMode: "debug"`. The configurations consistently use `codeLens` for easier debugging and running of specific files or tests, with titles indicating their purpose (e.g., "(dev)" or "(golden)"). The `request: "launch"` and `type: "dart"` are standard for all Flutter configurations.
