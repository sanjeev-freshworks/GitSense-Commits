# Activity Summary for 2/13/2026

## 2:48:54 PM
The log captures multiple saves of a single document, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`, between February 10, 2026, at 2:44:43 PM and February 12, 2026, at 1:54:53 PM. The content of the file remained identical across all recorded timestamps, indicating that these entries reflect repeated saves of the same planning or design document rather than distinct code changes.

The document itself details two primary feature discussions:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:**
    *   Outlines a mechanism using a deque (double-ended queue) to detect a "notification burst," defined as receiving `C` notifications within a `T` time threshold (e.g., C=3, T=15).
    *   Describes the process of adding notifications, checking for burst conditions (`T_latest - T_oldest < T`), and handling display logic for a special notification (shown only once per burst) versus normal notifications.
    *   Includes concrete examples and calculations to illustrate the burst detection.
    *   Lists several "Todo / suggestions" for this feature, such as allowing special notifications to show more than once, managing their IDs and positions, testing for double account IDs, automating notifications, refactoring `prevNotificationTime` to a list, refining deque reset logic, considering Gson injection, enhancing special notification display (title with account name, icon), adding click events, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:**
    *   Specifies the logic for managing when an app review prompt should be displayed, including resetting a counter for 90 days after the prompt is shown, and incrementing it otherwise.
    *   Identifies "App Review TODOs" like testing current implementation and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   Documents a series of "Questions," categorizing them as "Unanswered" (e.g., module placement, duplicate API calls) and "Answered" (e.g., asset addition for tickets, agent ticket creation, data loss on uninstall, separate PR for refactoring, user on-call status detection, use of shared preferences).
    *   Provides additional "todo" items for the app review prompt, such as immediate display upon condition fulfillment, avoiding increment for browser-based solution articles, and showing the prompt for "seen" events.

Other minor points mentioned include handling MDM Browser Config rotation and noting that a "Replace png with svg" commit is not yet pushed. The document serves as a comprehensive post-grooming checklist or discussion log covering implementation details, open questions, and future tasks for these features within the Freshservice application.
