# Activity Summary for 2/20/2026

## 2:16:34 PM
The log primarily details activity on a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`.

**File-specific updates for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`:**
This file is a markdown document outlining discussions, logic, and to-do items related to two main features: "Notification Burst" and "App Review and Rating Prompt". The content of the file remained identical across all recorded timestamps, suggesting repeated saves or auto-saves of the same document rather than actual modifications captured in this log.

Key information within the document includes:
*   **Notification Burst Logic:** A detailed description of a system to detect "notification bursts" where `C` notifications are received within `T` time. It uses a deque (double-ended queue) to store notification timestamps and `isSpecialNotificationShown` boolean flag. Pseudo-code demonstrates the logic for pushing notifications, checking for bursts, showing a special notification, discarding subsequent notifications within a burst, and resetting the system when the time threshold `T` is exceeded. Example values `T=15` and `C=3` are used for illustration.
*   **Notification Burst To-Dos/Suggestions:** A list of actionable items for this feature, such as allowing special notifications to show more than once, defining notification IDs and controlling their position, testing for double account IDs, automating notifications, replacing a single `prevNotificationTime` with a list, refining deque reset logic, considering Gson injection, displaying account names/icons, adding click events, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.
*   **MDM Browser Config:** A brief mention of handling rotation for MDM Browser configuration.
*   **App Review and Rating Prompt Logic:** Rules for how the app review prompt counter should behave: reset for 90 days after showing, then resume incrementing; continue incrementing if not yet shown.
*   **App Review To-Dos:** Tasks like testing the existing app review code, refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
*   **Questions (Answered and Unanswered):** Discussions regarding module placement, duplicate API calls (a potential bug to fix), asset attachment validity for ticket changes/closures, agent ticket creation, detecting "different" events (decided against), data persistence on uninstall (not an issue), creating separate PRs for refactoring (recommended), identifying on-call users (not needed, increment on `ShiftEventActivity` opening), maintaining persona independence, and using shared preferences for counts. Specific to-dos for app review prompt display are also noted: show immediately when logic is met, avoid incrementing for solution articles in browser, and show for "seen" events.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
As the content for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` is identical across all entries, there are no *content-specific* changes to highlight by timestamp. The various timestamps (ranging from 2/10/2026, 2:44:43 PM to 2/20/2026, 2:13:41 PM) merely indicate moments when the file's current state was recorded, rather than substantive modifications.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**
The most striking pattern is the repeated logging of the exact same content for the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` file over several days. This suggests that the log is capturing regular save operations rather than granular code modifications. The content itself is a well-structured grooming document, demonstrating a thought process for designing and implementing features with specific acceptance criteria, to-dos, and questions.
