# Activity Summary for 2/12/2026

## 2:14:39 PM
The single file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` was repeatedly logged with identical content across multiple timestamps, ranging from February 10, 2026, at 2:44:43 PM to February 12, 2026, at 1:54:53 PM. This indicates a consistent snapshot of a document rather than a series of content changes.

The document appears to be a "Post Grooming" markdown file, outlining technical design, discussion points, and To-Do items for several features within the Freshservice application.

Key information from the content includes:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:**
    *   Detailed algorithm for detecting a "notification burst" using a deque (double-ended queue) to store notification timestamps.
    *   The logic defines `T` (time threshold, e.g., 15 units) and `C` (count threshold, e.g., 3 notifications) to determine if `C` notifications have occurred within `T` time.
    *   A `isSpecialNotificationShown` boolean ensures a special notification is shown only once per burst, with subsequent notifications within the same burst being discarded or handled differently.
    *   Includes concrete examples and an explanation of why a specific scenario ("T14 - T28 (diff = 14) there are only 2 notifications till now") is not considered a burst, adhering to acceptance criteria.
    *   **To-Do/Suggestions related to Notification Burst:** Many follow-up tasks are listed, such as enabling special notifications to show more than once, managing their ID and position, testing with double account IDs, automating notifications, refining deque reset logic, injecting Gson, displaying titles with account names, showing icons, adding click events, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.
    *   **Branch/Commit Notes:** Mentions an unpushed commit to replace PNG with SVG and to replace/update existing special notifications.

2.  **MDM Browser Config:**
    *   A brief note to "handle rotation."

3.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:**
    *   Outlines the logic for showing the prompt: the counter resets when the prompt is shown and does not increment for the next 90 days. After 90 days, incrementing resumes. If the prompt has not yet been shown, the counter keeps incrementing.
    *   **App Review To-Do:** Tasks include testing the current app review code, and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   **Questions & Answers:** A section with both unanswered (e.g., separate module vs. core, `update tasks api` being called twice) and answered questions regarding the feature's implementation details (e.g., asset addition for tickets, agent ticket creation, data loss on uninstall, separate PR for refactoring, recognizing on-call users, using shared preferences, and showing the prompt on any screen).
    *   **Specific App Review To-Do:** Immediately show the prompt on the page where the logic is achieved, avoid incrementing for browser cases in solution articles, and for "seen" events, show the prompt (sentence incomplete).

**Recurring Elements:**
The most prominent pattern is the exact repetition of the entire document's content across all log entries, indicating that these logs capture the state of the document at various save points rather than showing iterative changes to the text itself. The document consistently details design and development notes for notification bursts and app review prompts, along with related tasks and resolved questions.
