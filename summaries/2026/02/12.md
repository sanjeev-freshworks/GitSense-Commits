# Activity Summary for 2/12/2026

## 2:14:39 PM
The single file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` was repeatedly logged with identical content across multiple timestamps, ranging from February 10, 2026, at 2:44:43 PM to February 12, 2026, at 1:54:53 PM. This indicates a consistent snapshot of a document rather than a series of content changes.

The document appears to be a "Post Grooming" markdown file, outlining technical design, discussion points, and To-Do items for several features within the Freshservice application.

Key information from the content includes:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:**
    *   Detailed algorithm for detecting a "notification burst" using a deque (double-ended queue) to store notification timestamps.
    *   The logic defines `T` (time threshold, e.g., 15 units) and `C` (count threshold, e.g., 3 notifications) to determine if `C` notifications have occurred within `T` time.
    *   A `isSpecialNotificationShown` boolean ensures a special notification is shown only once per burst, with subsequent notifications within the same burst being discarded or handled differently.
    *   Includes concrete examples and an explanation of why a specific scenario ("T14 - T28 (diff = 14) there are only 2 notifications till now") is not considered a burst, adhering to acceptance criteria.
    *   **To-Do/Suggestions related to Notification Burst:** Many follow-up tasks are listed, such as enabling special notifications to show more than once, managing their ID and position, testing with double account IDs, automating notifications, refining deque reset logic, injecting Gson, displaying titles with account names, showing icons, adding click events, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.
    *   **Branch/Commit Notes:** Mentions an unpushed commit to replace PNG with SVG and to replace/update existing special notifications.

2.  **MDM Browser Config:**
    *   A brief note to "handle rotation."

3.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:**
    *   Outlines the logic for showing the prompt: the counter resets when the prompt is shown and does not increment for the next 90 days. After 90 days, incrementing resumes. If the prompt has not yet been shown, the counter keeps incrementing.
    *   **App Review To-Do:** Tasks include testing the current app review code, and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   **Questions & Answers:** A section with both unanswered (e.g., separate module vs. core, `update tasks api` being called twice) and answered questions regarding the feature's implementation details (e.g., asset addition for tickets, agent ticket creation, data loss on uninstall, separate PR for refactoring, recognizing on-call users, using shared preferences, and showing the prompt on any screen).
    *   **Specific App Review To-Do:** Immediately show the prompt on the page where the logic is achieved, avoid incrementing for browser cases in solution articles, and for "seen" events, show the prompt (sentence incomplete).

**Recurring Elements:**
The most prominent pattern is the exact repetition of the entire document's content across all log entries, indicating that these logs capture the state of the document at various save points rather than showing iterative changes to the text itself. The document consistently details design and development notes for notification bursts and app review prompts, along with related tasks and resolved questions.

## 3:14:37 PM
The logs indicate activity on a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`.

All entries for this file, spanning from `2/10/2026, 2:44:43 PM` to `2/12/2026, 1:54:53 PM`, contain identical content. This suggests that the file was frequently saved or logged without any modifications to its content during this period.

The content of the file outlines two primary feature discussions:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic**: This section details a system using a deque to detect a "burst" of notifications (C notifications within T time). It specifies the behavior for normal notifications, showing a special notification (once per burst), or discarding subsequent notifications within a burst. Example scenarios with timestamps are provided to illustrate the logic. Associated "Todo / suggestions" include considerations for showing special notifications multiple times, handling notification IDs and positioning, testing with double account IDs, automating notifications, replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list, resetting the deque, injecting Gson, displaying titles with account names, adding click events, checking count usage, and adding setters/getters for `ListNotificationViewModel`.
2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt**: This section describes the logic for managing an in-app review prompt. The counter for the prompt should reset when shown and not increment for the next 90 days. After 90 days, it should resume incrementing. If the prompt has not been shown, the counter continues to increment. "App Review TODO" items include testing the current code and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`. Various questions are also listed, some answered (e.g., adding assets to tickets, agent ticket creation, refactoring PRs, user on-call status, using shared preferences) and some unanswered (e.g., separate module, duplicate API calls). Additional "todo" items mention showing the prompt immediately when logic is achieved, not incrementing for browser-based solution articles, and showing for "seen" events.

Other minor mentions include "MDM Browser Config - handle rotation" and "Replace png with svg commit is not pushed yet - Replace/Update existing special notification."

The overall pattern observed is a detailed planning document for two distinct features, with extensive logic, examples, and outstanding tasks/questions, all recorded consistently across multiple timestamps without content variations.

## 4:14:37 PM
The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` was recorded multiple times on 2/10/2026 between 2:44:43 PM and 2:45:28 PM, and again on 2/12/2026 between 12:11:43 PM and 1:54:53 PM. All entries show identical content, indicating that the file was saved or logged without any actual changes to its content during these periods.

The document primarily serves as a post-grooming note or design specification, detailing two main features:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:** This section outlines a system to detect and manage notification "bursts."
    *   It defines a mechanism using a deque (double-ended queue) to store notification timestamps, with parameters `T` (time threshold) and `C` (count threshold).
    *   Pseudocode and examples demonstrate how incoming notifications are processed: if fewer than `C` notifications have arrived, normal notifications are shown; if `C` or more notifications arrive within `T` time, a "special notification" is triggered, and subsequent notifications might be discarded.
    *   There is a clear acceptance criterion: "Special Notification should be shown when we receive C notifications within T time."
    *   Numerous "Todo / suggestions" are listed, covering aspects like showing special notifications multiple times, defining their ID and position, testing with double account IDs, automating notifications, replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list, refining deque reset logic, injecting `gson` into `NotificationBurstConverter`, displaying title with account name/icon, adding click events, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.
    *   A pending branch change mentions replacing PNGs with SVGs and updating existing special notifications.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:** This section details the logic for displaying an app review prompt.
    *   The prompt's counter should reset for 90 days after it's shown, then start incrementing again. If the prompt hasn't been shown, the counter continues to increment.
    *   "App Review TODO" items include testing current functionality and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   A "Questions" section distinguishes between unanswered queries (e.g., need for a separate module, duplicate API calls for update tasks) and answered ones (e.g., asset validity for ticket changes/closing, agent ticket creation, data loss on uninstall, separate PR for refactoring, on-call status detection, using shared preferences, showing prompt on any screen).
    *   Specific "todo" items for app review include immediately showing the prompt when its logic is met, preventing increments for solution articles in the browser case, and showing the prompt for "seen" events.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The document consistently uses a structured, bulleted format for design notes, suggestions, and questions. It employs pseudocode-like explanations for complex logic (like the notification deque). The content indicates an active development phase, with discussions on implementation details, acceptance criteria, and future tasks related to mobile application features (notifications and app review prompts). The focus is on user experience (special notifications, prompt timing) and technical considerations (data structures, view models, persistence).
