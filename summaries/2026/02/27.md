# Activity Summary for 2/27/2026

## 2:22:04 PM
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/form/fields/requester/model/form_requester_field_ui_data.dart`.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The `form_requester_field_ui_data.dart` file defines the `FormRequesterFieldUIData` class, which serves as a UI data model for a requester field within a form. It stores a `FSUserUIModel` (representing the requester) and an optional `workspaceId`. Key functionalities include:
*   Providing the requester's email and ID to generate `FormFieldDomainModel` instances, crucial for form submission and processing.
*   Extracting the requester's email for condition and business rule (BR) validations.
*   Implementing `copyWith`, `copyValueFrom`, `operator==`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods for data manipulation and object comparison.

The only difference between the two log entries for this file is the addition of a second comment containing a URL related to Freshservice business rules. The first entry at `2/27/2026, 12:30:59 PM` includes one such URL comment. The second entry at `2/27/2026, 12:31:32 PM` adds another, more detailed URL comment, implying further exploration or documentation of the business rule API integration. No functional code changes were made in this specific update.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
Both changes occurred on `2/27/2026`, within a very short span of 33 seconds (from `12:30:59 PM` to `12:31:32 PM`). This indicates a rapid, minor update, likely for documentation or context-setting purposes rather than a functional code modification.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
*   **Requester Email as Identifier:** The `value?.email` is consistently used as the primary identifier for creating domain models and for business rule validations, suggesting its importance in the system's logic for user identification and rule processing.
*   **Business Rule Integration:** The presence of comments with Freshservice URLs pointing to "business_rules" indicates that this field's data is heavily integrated with an external or internal business rule engine, likely for dynamic form behavior or validation.
*   **Flutter Project Structure:** The file path `/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/...` points to a Flutter application for Freshservice, with a modular structure separating features like `support_portal` and reusable components like `form_lib` and `core_ui`.
*   **Data Modeling for UI:** The class name `FormRequesterFieldUIData` and its implementation of `FormCustomFieldData` highlight a pattern of creating dedicated UI data models to encapsulate form field logic and presentation.

The provided log details changes exclusively to a single Markdown file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`. All entries for this file, spanning timestamps from 2/27/2026, 11:41:45 AM to 2/27/2026, 11:42:23 AM, show identical content, indicating multiple saves of the same document rather than substantive code changes within this log.

The content of the `Post Grooming.md` file outlines several key development discussions and action items:

**1. Notification Burst Logic (`# Notification Burst T C`):**
*   **Core Logic:** Describes a mechanism to detect a "burst" of notifications using a deque (`back[]front`) to store recent notification timestamps. A burst is identified if `C` notifications are received within a `T` time threshold.
*   **Special Notification:** A `bool isSpecialNotificationShown` flag manages the display of a special notification, ensuring it's shown only once per burst.
*   **Process Flow:** Detailed steps illustrate how notifications `T0` through `T4` are handled, including pushing to the front, popping from the back, comparing timestamps (e.g., `T3 - T0 < T`), and deciding whether to show a normal or special notification, or discard.
*   **Examples:** Specific values `T = 15`, `C = 3` are given, along with timestamp sequences (`T0 = epoch + 0`, `T5 = epoch + 5`, etc.) to demonstrate burst detection and edge cases.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** A "Special Notification should be shown when we receive C notifications within T time."
*   **ToDos/Suggestions:**
    *   Allow special notifications to show more than once.
    *   Control notification ID and position (currently bottom, can be top with `setSortKey`).
    *   Test for double account IDs and automate notifications.
    *   Refactor: replace `prevNotificationTime` with a list, work on deque resetting logic, check Gson injection in `NotificationBurstConverter`.
    *   UX/UI: Display title with account name, attach to group, show icon, add click event.
    *   Data: Add setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`, rename `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

**2. General Development & Grooming Topics:**
*   **Branch Notes:** Mentions a commit to "Replace png with svg" that is not yet pushed, and updates to existing special notifications.
*   **MDM Browser Config:** Item for handling rotation.
*   **App Review and Rating Prompt:**
    *   **Counter Logic:** Describes a 90-day reset mechanism for the prompt counter: resets after prompt is shown and should not increment for 90 days, then increments again. Increments normally if the prompt hasn't been shown.
    *   **ToDos:** Test current app review code, refactor `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   **Questions (Grooming):**
        *   **Unanswered:** Whether a separate module is needed for this feature, and if a double API call for `update tasks` should be fixed.
        *   **Answered:** Clarifications on adding assets to tickets (valid for changes/closing), agent ticket creation, detecting "different" events (don't), data loss on uninstall (not a concern), separate PR for refactoring (yes), recognizing on-call users (no need, increment on `ShiftEventActivity` open), persona independence, use of shared preferences (no account-wise/unique counts), and showing the prompt on any screen (move logic from `HomeActivity` to `AppReviewManager`).
        *   **Further ToDos:** Immediately show prompt on logic achievement page, don't increment for browser solution articles, show prompt for "seen" events.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   The document serves as a detailed grooming log, combining high-level feature explanations with granular implementation details, edge cases, and open questions/suggestions.
*   There's a strong focus on notification management and user engagement (app reviews).
*   The use of pseudocode-like examples (deque operations, timestamp comparisons) is consistent for illustrating logic.
*   A clear distinction is made between "Todo/suggestions" and "Questions" (unanswered/answered), indicating a structured grooming process.
*   Refactoring and architectural considerations (separate modules, shared preferences, renaming items) are recurring themes.
