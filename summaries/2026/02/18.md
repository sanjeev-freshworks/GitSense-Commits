# Activity Summary for 2/18/2026

## 1:59:53 PM
The log primarily details activity on two files: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` and `/Users/skumar14/.zshrc`.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`**

This markdown file, `Post Grooming.md`, was frequently accessed and saved across multiple days: February 10, 2026, February 12, 2026, and February 17, 2026, with many entries timestamped mere seconds apart on the same day. Despite the numerous timestamps, the content of the file remained identical across all logged entries, indicating repeated saving without substantive changes or a logging system that captures file state at save points.

The document outlines discussions and design considerations for two main features:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic**: This section details an algorithm using a deque (double-ended queue) to detect a "burst" of `C` notifications within a `T` time window. It includes specific examples (`T=15, C=3`) and step-by-step logic for handling new notifications, showing special notifications, or discarding them based on burst conditions. A `boolean` flag `isSpecialNotificationShown` is used to control the display of special notifications.
    *   **Todo/Suggestions for Notification Burst**: Key development tasks include showing special notifications multiple times, defining their ID and position, automating notifications, replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list, refining deque reset logic, injecting Gson, customizing special notification titles/icons with account names, adding click events, managing a `count` variable, and implementing setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`. There's also a suggestion to rename `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.
    *   A side note mentions a "branch" related to replacing PNG with SVG, but the commit is not yet pushed.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt**: This section outlines the logic for displaying an in-app review prompt. The counter for the prompt should reset and not increment for 90 days after the prompt is shown. After the 90-day period, incrementing resumes. If the prompt hasn't been shown, the counter continues to increment.
    *   **App Review TODOs**: These tasks include testing the current app review code, and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   **Questions (Answered & Unanswered)**:
        *   Unanswered: Whether a separate module is needed for app review or if it's fine in the core module, and if a double API call for "update tasks" needs fixing.
        *   Answered: Clarifications on adding assets to tickets (valid for changes/closing), agent ticket creation (fine), detecting "different" (don't), data loss on uninstall (not an issue), creating a separate PR for refactoring (yes, as per Vasanth's review), and recognizing if a user is on-call (not needed, just increment on `ShiftEventActivity` opening).
    *   **General Decisions**: Keep logic persona-independent, use shared preferences (no account-wise/unique counts), and move app review prompt logic from `HomeActivity` to `AppReviewManager` to allow display on any screen where conditions are met.
    *   **App Review TODOs (Specific)**: Immediately show the prompt on the page where the logic condition is met, do not increment for solution articles accessed via browser, and show the prompt for "seen" events when the user... (the sentence is incomplete).

**File: `/Users/skumar14/.zshrc`**

This file, a shell configuration file, was updated on February 18, 2026, at 1:05:05 PM. As per the instructions, the content of this file is not summarized due to its nature as an environment file potentially storing sensitive keys (e.g., `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_LOCATION`, `RELEASE_STORE_PASS`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The primary pattern observed is the repeated saving of the `Post Grooming.md` file without apparent content changes over several days. This suggests ongoing active work, review, or discussion around the outlined features, where the document serves as a central point for requirements, design, and development tasks. The structure of the markdown file with detailed logic, examples, and organized "Todo / suggestions" and "Questions" sections indicates a structured approach to development planning. The `.zshrc` update reflects typical developer environment configuration, likely related to setting up development tools or deployment credentials.
