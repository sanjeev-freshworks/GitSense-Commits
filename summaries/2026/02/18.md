# Activity Summary for 2/18/2026

## 1:59:53 PM
The log primarily details activity on two files: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` and `/Users/skumar14/.zshrc`.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`**

This markdown file, `Post Grooming.md`, was frequently accessed and saved across multiple days: February 10, 2026, February 12, 2026, and February 17, 2026, with many entries timestamped mere seconds apart on the same day. Despite the numerous timestamps, the content of the file remained identical across all logged entries, indicating repeated saving without substantive changes or a logging system that captures file state at save points.

The document outlines discussions and design considerations for two main features:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic**: This section details an algorithm using a deque (double-ended queue) to detect a "burst" of `C` notifications within a `T` time window. It includes specific examples (`T=15, C=3`) and step-by-step logic for handling new notifications, showing special notifications, or discarding them based on burst conditions. A `boolean` flag `isSpecialNotificationShown` is used to control the display of special notifications.
    *   **Todo/Suggestions for Notification Burst**: Key development tasks include showing special notifications multiple times, defining their ID and position, automating notifications, replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list, refining deque reset logic, injecting Gson, customizing special notification titles/icons with account names, adding click events, managing a `count` variable, and implementing setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`. There's also a suggestion to rename `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.
    *   A side note mentions a "branch" related to replacing PNG with SVG, but the commit is not yet pushed.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt**: This section outlines the logic for displaying an in-app review prompt. The counter for the prompt should reset and not increment for 90 days after the prompt is shown. After the 90-day period, incrementing resumes. If the prompt hasn't been shown, the counter continues to increment.
    *   **App Review TODOs**: These tasks include testing the current app review code, and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   **Questions (Answered & Unanswered)**:
        *   Unanswered: Whether a separate module is needed for app review or if it's fine in the core module, and if a double API call for "update tasks" needs fixing.
        *   Answered: Clarifications on adding assets to tickets (valid for changes/closing), agent ticket creation (fine), detecting "different" (don't), data loss on uninstall (not an issue), creating a separate PR for refactoring (yes, as per Vasanth's review), and recognizing if a user is on-call (not needed, just increment on `ShiftEventActivity` opening).
    *   **General Decisions**: Keep logic persona-independent, use shared preferences (no account-wise/unique counts), and move app review prompt logic from `HomeActivity` to `AppReviewManager` to allow display on any screen where conditions are met.
    *   **App Review TODOs (Specific)**: Immediately show the prompt on the page where the logic condition is met, do not increment for solution articles accessed via browser, and show the prompt for "seen" events when the user... (the sentence is incomplete).

**File: `/Users/skumar14/.zshrc`**

This file, a shell configuration file, was updated on February 18, 2026, at 1:05:05 PM. As per the instructions, the content of this file is not summarized due to its nature as an environment file potentially storing sensitive keys (e.g., `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_LOCATION`, `RELEASE_STORE_PASS`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The primary pattern observed is the repeated saving of the `Post Grooming.md` file without apparent content changes over several days. This suggests ongoing active work, review, or discussion around the outlined features, where the document serves as a central point for requirements, design, and development tasks. The structure of the markdown file with detailed logic, examples, and organized "Todo / suggestions" and "Questions" sections indicates a structured approach to development planning. The `.zshrc` update reflects typical developer environment configuration, likely related to setting up development tools or deployment credentials.

## 2:59:46 PM
The log primarily details activity related to a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`, with one unrelated change to a shell configuration file.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md:** This Markdown file, acting as a "Post Grooming" document, was repeatedly logged from **February 10, 2026, 2:44:43 PM** to **February 17, 2026, 2:23:26 PM**. Across all these entries, the content of the file remains identical. The document outlines two main areas:
    *   **Notification Burst Logic:** A detailed pseudo-code description of a system using a deque to detect a "burst" of notifications. The logic defines rules for showing "special notifications" if `C` notifications are received within `T` time, otherwise normal notifications are shown or discarded. It includes examples (`T=15`, `C=3`) and a discussion of acceptance criteria.
    *   **App Review and Rating Prompt Logic:** Rules for displaying an in-app review prompt, including conditions for resetting and incrementing a counter (e.g., resetting for 90 days after prompt display, incrementing after 90 days, or incrementing if not yet shown).
    *   **To-Do/Suggestions and Questions:** A comprehensive list of outstanding tasks and answered/unanswered questions related to both notification bursts (e.g., showing special notifications multiple times, notification IDs, icon display, click events, renaming items, handling account IDs) and app review (e.g., testing current code, refactoring, module placement, API calls, user on-call detection, shared preferences, prompt display location, specific event exclusions). It also mentions a general branch task to "Replace png with svg".

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

There are no *content* changes recorded for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` across the provided timestamps. All entries for this file simply re-log the same content. The timestamps (from February 10 to February 17, 2026) suggest that this document was frequently accessed, reviewed, or used as a reference during this period.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Repeated Content:** The most striking pattern is the identical content of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` being logged multiple times over several days. This indicates that the document itself is a stable, living specification or planning artifact that was regularly consulted or updated without content modifications within these logs.
*   **Detailed Logic Specification:** The document consistently provides highly detailed pseudo-code and logical steps for complex features like notification management and user interaction prompts, reflecting a thorough grooming or design phase.
*   **Actionable Items and Queries:** The presence of extensive "Todo / suggestions" and "Questions" sections points to an active development cycle where requirements are being refined, tasks are being identified, and implementation details are being discussed and clarified.

## 9:59:49 PM
The log primarily details changes across two files.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`**
This Markdown document, consistently updated between February 10, 2026, 2:44:43 PM and February 17, 2026, 2:23:26 PM, contains detailed notes and discussions related to two main features:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:**
    *   Describes an algorithm using a deque to detect a "burst" of notifications, defined as receiving `C` notifications within `T` time.
    *   Includes pseudocode-like steps for handling incoming notifications (`T0` to `T4`), managing the deque, and deciding whether to show a normal or a special notification.
    *   Illustrates the logic with concrete examples using `T=15` and `C=3` and example timestamps.
    *   Outlines a list of `Todo / suggestions` for this feature, focusing on special notification behavior (showing multiple times, ID, position control, icon display, click events, displaying account name), handling double account IDs, automating notifications, replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list, resetting deque logic, injecting Gson in `NotificationBurstConverter`, and adding getters/setters in `ListNotificationViewModel`.
    *   Suggests renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.
2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:**
    *   Details the logic for showing the app review prompt, including resetting a counter when the prompt is shown, not incrementing for 90 days afterward, and resuming incrementing once the 90-day period expires.
    *   Lists `App Review TODO` items: testing the existing code and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   Contains a `Questions` section with previously `Unanswered` and `Answered` points regarding module separation, duplicate API calls (`update tasks api`), asset handling, agent ticket creation, data loss on uninstall, GitHub PR strategy for refactoring, user on-call status detection, usage of shared preferences, and the screen on which the prompt should appear.
    *   Additional `todo` items for the app review prompt include showing it immediately when the logic condition is met, not incrementing for solution articles accessed via browser, and showing for "seen" events.
3.  **Other Development Notes:** Mentions "MDM Browser Config - handle rotation" and "Replace png with svg commit is not pushed yet" under a "branch" section.

A notable pattern in this file is the frequent saving or identical content across multiple timestamps (e.g., eight identical entries on February 12, 2026, and four on February 10, 2026), suggesting iterative thought processes, minor formatting changes not captured, or frequent saves of the working document.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/.zshrc`**
This file was updated on February 18, 2026, 1:05:05 PM. It primarily involves shell configuration and environment variable declarations related to Android development (e.g., `ANDROID_HOME`, `JAVA_HOME`, `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`), Go development (`GOPATH`, `GOBIN`, `PROTOC`), Flutter (`FLUTTER_HOME`), and Melos. Due to the presence of sensitive keys (`RELEASE_STORE_PASS`, `RELEASE_KEY_PASS`) within the environment variable definitions, the detailed content is not summarized.
