# Activity Summary for 2/19/2026

## 2:51:36 AM
The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` contains detailed design and to-do notes related to two main features: "Notification Burst" and "App Review and Rating Prompt."

**File-specific updates for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`:**
The content of this markdown file remained identical across all recorded timestamps in the log. It functions as a comprehensive record of discussions, logic, and pending tasks from a "Post Grooming" session.

The "Notification Burst" section details a mechanism using a deque to detect a "burst" of notifications based on time (`T`) and count (`C`) thresholds. It outlines the state (`isSpecialNotificationShown`), the deque operations (push_front, pop_back), and the logic for showing normal vs. special notifications, including scenarios for discarding notifications or clearing the deque. Examples with specific timestamps are provided to illustrate burst detection.

The document also lists several "Todo / suggestions" related to notification bursts, such as:
*   Showing special notifications multiple times.
*   Controlling notification IDs and positions.
*   Testing for double account IDs and automating notifications.
*   Refining the deque resetting logic and replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list.
*   Technical considerations like injecting `gson` in `NotificationBurstConverter`.
*   UI/UX aspects such as displaying account names, showing icons, and adding click events for special notifications.
*   Data model updates like adding setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

Other topics briefly mentioned include:
*   Branch-related notes (replacing `png` with `svg`, updating special notifications).
*   MDM Browser Config (handling rotation).
*   "App Review and Rating Prompt" logic, including rules for incrementing/resetting counters based on when the prompt was shown (or not shown) and a 90-day cooldown period.
*   "App Review TODOs" such as testing current code and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
*   A "Questions" section with both unanswered queries (e.g., module separation, duplicate API calls) and answered ones covering various functional aspects like asset handling, agent ticket creation, data retention on uninstall, and implementation details for detecting user "oncall" status or using shared preferences. Specific app review todos are also outlined, like immediately showing the prompt and not incrementing for solution articles in the browser.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
While the content itself did not change, the file was logged multiple times, indicating review or saving activity on:
*   February 10, 2026, between 2:44:43 PM and 2:45:28 PM.
*   February 12, 2026, between 12:11:43 PM and 1:54:53 PM.
*   February 17, 2026, between 2:21:47 PM and 2:23:26 PM.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**
The document consistently uses a structured markdown format with bullet points for TODOs and suggestions, clear headings for different features, and detailed pseudo-code/logic explanations. A recurring pattern is the breakdown of issues or features into their current state, proposed logic/solution, and a list of specific tasks or questions, often prefaced with "Todo / suggestions" or "Questions". The format indicates a systematic approach to technical design and project management for mobile application features.

The file `/Users/skumar14/.zshrc` has been excluded from the summary as it contains sensitive information (e.g., `RELEASE_STORE_PASS`, `RELEASE_KEY_PASS`).
