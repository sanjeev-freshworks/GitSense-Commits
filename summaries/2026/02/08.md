# Activity Summary for 2/8/2026

## 1:47:47 PM
The log primarily details updates to a markdown file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`, with a timestamp of 2/8/2026, 9:27:19 AM.

This file serves as a detailed design and grooming document, outlining logic and tasks for several features:

*   **Notification Burst Logic**: A significant portion details the implementation of a "Notification Burst" feature. It describes how to detect a burst (C notifications within T time) using a deque (double-ended queue) and manage the display of a special notification. The logic includes step-by-step examples (e.g., T0 through T4 notifications), specific parameters (T=15, C=3), and a boolean flag (`isSpecialNotificationShown`) to control the visibility of the special notification, ensuring it's not shown repeatedly during a single burst. There's a specific discussion on how notification arrival times relate to the burst criteria.
*   **App Review and Rating Prompt**: This section outlines the conditions for showing an in-app review prompt. Key points include resetting a counter after the prompt is shown, a 90-day cooldown period before the counter starts incrementing again, and continuous incrementing if the prompt hasn't been shown yet. It also lists TODOs for testing the existing code, refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`, and specific conditions for when the prompt should or shouldn't increment or be displayed (e.g., not for solution articles in browser, immediately on logic achievement).
*   **General Development Tasks and Questions**: The document includes various to-do items and discussions covering broader development aspects:
    *   **Notification enhancements**: Suggestions for making special notifications more configurable (e.g., multiple shows, ID, position, icon, click events), managing account IDs, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem`.
    *   **Technical Refinements**: Tasks like replacing `png` with `svg`, handling MDM browser configuration rotation, and investigating `gson` injection in `NotificationBurstConverter`.
    *   **Design Discussions**: A clear pattern of "Unanswered" and "Answered" questions addresses architectural decisions (e.g., module separation, API call frequency, PR strategy for refactoring), implementation details (e.g., asset validity for changes, agent ticket creation, on-call detection), and data persistence (e.g., shared preferences for counts, data loss on uninstall).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements**:
The document uses a structured format with "Todo / suggestions:", bullet points for tasks, and clearly delineated "Questions: Unanswered" and "Answered" sections. The continuous refinement of logic, particularly for notification bursts, with specific examples and edge cases, is a recurring theme. There's a strong emphasis on user experience (notification display, app review prompt) and robust implementation (refactoring, testing, handling different scenarios).
