# Activity Summary for 2/16/2026

## 12:13:19 AM
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`. All logged entries, spanning from 2/10/2026, 2:44:43 PM to 2/12/2026, 1:54:53 PM, show identical content, suggesting no actual code modifications were committed or saved between these timestamps, but rather the file was likely opened, viewed, or saved without changes.

The document itself is a "Post Grooming" note covering two main areas:

**1. Notification Burst Logic:**
This section outlines a system to detect a "burst" of notifications, defined as receiving a certain number (`C`) of notifications within a specified time (`T`).
*   It uses a `deque` (double-ended queue) to store notification timestamps.
*   When a new notification arrives, it's compared against the oldest timestamp in the deque.
*   If `C` notifications are received within `T` time, a "special notification" is shown once (`isSpecialNotificationShown` flag prevents repeats). Otherwise, a normal notification is displayed, and the deque might be reset.
*   Example scenarios with `T=15` and `C=3` are provided to illustrate the logic.
*   **Key TODO/Suggestions:** Several improvements are listed, including making special notifications appear more than once, managing their IDs and position, testing for double account IDs, automating notifications, refactoring `prevNotificationTime` to use a list, refining deque reset logic, injecting `gson` into `NotificationBurstConverter`, enhancing special notification display (title, icon, click event), checking count usage, adding setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

**2. App Review and Rating Prompt:**
This section details the logic for displaying an app review prompt.
*   When the prompt is shown, a counter should reset and not increment for the next 90 days.
*   After the 90-day period, incrementing resumes.
*   If the prompt hasn't been shown, the counter continues to increment.
*   **Key TODOs:** Testing the existing app review code, refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
*   **Questions and Answers:** Various implementation and architectural questions are addressed, covering module placement (core module is fine), fixing a double API call for update tasks, asset validity for ticket changes/closures (yes), agent ticket creation, detecting "difference" (don't), data loss on uninstall (not an issue), separate PR for refactoring (yes), identifying on-call users (no need, increment on `ShiftEventActivity` open), maintaining persona independence, using shared preferences without account-wise counts, and moving app review logic from `HomeActivity` to `AppReviewManager` to enable showing the prompt on any screen.
*   **Specific App Review TODOs:** Immediately showing the prompt upon condition achievement, preventing increment for browser cases in solution articles, and showing the prompt for "seen" events (details incomplete).

**3. Branch-related notes:**
Brief notes indicate unpushed commits related to replacing PNGs with SVGs and updating existing special notifications, along with handling rotation for MDM Browser Config.

**Pattern:**
The recurring pattern is the identical content logged for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` across multiple timestamps. This indicates that while the file state was captured at different times, no actual textual changes were introduced.

## 5:22:35 AM
The log details changes to a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`, with multiple entries recorded on 2/10/2026 and 2/12/2026.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The content of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` remains identical across all logged timestamps. This indicates that while the file was accessed or saved multiple times, no actual content modifications were introduced during the period captured by the log. The document serves as a "Post Grooming" markdown, outlining design, logic, and pending tasks for features within the Freshservice application.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
There are no content-specific changes to highlight based on timestamps, as the content is consistently the same across all entries. The timestamps primarily mark moments when the file's state was recorded:
*   **February 10, 2026, around 2:44 PM - 2:45 PM:** A series of closely spaced entries.
*   **February 12, 2026, around 12:11 PM and 1:48 PM - 1:54 PM:** Another series of closely spaced entries, roughly two days after the initial set.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in Content:**
The document consistently covers two main areas:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:**
    *   Detailed explanation of a notification burst detection mechanism using a `deque` (doubly-ended queue).
    *   Defines parameters `T` (time threshold, e.g., 15) and `C` (count threshold, e.g., 3) for identifying a burst.
    *   Outlines how a `special notification` is shown only once per burst, with subsequent burst notifications being discarded or ignored.
    *   Includes example timelines (e.g., T0, T5, T13, T14, T28) to illustrate the logic.
    *   Lists numerous "Todo / suggestions" related to special notifications, such as showing them more than once, managing notification IDs, controlling position, testing for double account IDs, automating notifications, refactoring data structures (replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list), resetting the deque, and displaying account names/icons. It also suggests renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:**
    *   Describes the logic for showing an in-app review prompt.
    *   Specifies rules for resetting and incrementing a counter: resetting after the prompt is shown for 90 days, then resuming incrementing.
    *   Identifies "App Review TODO" items, including testing the current implementation and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   Presents a "Questions" section with "Unanswered" and "Answered" items, covering architectural choices (module placement), API performance (duplicate task API calls), event tracking conditions (adding/changing/closing tickets, agent ticket creation, user on-call status), data handling (uninstall data loss), development workflow (separate PR for refactoring), and user experience (persona independence, using shared preferences, showing prompt on the page where logic is achieved, excluding browser solution articles).

In addition, there are brief notes about ongoing branch work, specifically "Replace png with svg" and "MDM Browser Config - handle rotation". The repeated content across different timestamps implies the document is a continuously evolving internal design and task tracking file, with its stable state being captured by the log at various points.
