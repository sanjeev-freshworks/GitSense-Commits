# Activity Summary for 2/16/2026

## 12:13:19 AM
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`. All logged entries, spanning from 2/10/2026, 2:44:43 PM to 2/12/2026, 1:54:53 PM, show identical content, suggesting no actual code modifications were committed or saved between these timestamps, but rather the file was likely opened, viewed, or saved without changes.

The document itself is a "Post Grooming" note covering two main areas:

**1. Notification Burst Logic:**
This section outlines a system to detect a "burst" of notifications, defined as receiving a certain number (`C`) of notifications within a specified time (`T`).
*   It uses a `deque` (double-ended queue) to store notification timestamps.
*   When a new notification arrives, it's compared against the oldest timestamp in the deque.
*   If `C` notifications are received within `T` time, a "special notification" is shown once (`isSpecialNotificationShown` flag prevents repeats). Otherwise, a normal notification is displayed, and the deque might be reset.
*   Example scenarios with `T=15` and `C=3` are provided to illustrate the logic.
*   **Key TODO/Suggestions:** Several improvements are listed, including making special notifications appear more than once, managing their IDs and position, testing for double account IDs, automating notifications, refactoring `prevNotificationTime` to use a list, refining deque reset logic, injecting `gson` into `NotificationBurstConverter`, enhancing special notification display (title, icon, click event), checking count usage, adding setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

**2. App Review and Rating Prompt:**
This section details the logic for displaying an app review prompt.
*   When the prompt is shown, a counter should reset and not increment for the next 90 days.
*   After the 90-day period, incrementing resumes.
*   If the prompt hasn't been shown, the counter continues to increment.
*   **Key TODOs:** Testing the existing app review code, refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
*   **Questions and Answers:** Various implementation and architectural questions are addressed, covering module placement (core module is fine), fixing a double API call for update tasks, asset validity for ticket changes/closures (yes), agent ticket creation, detecting "difference" (don't), data loss on uninstall (not an issue), separate PR for refactoring (yes), identifying on-call users (no need, increment on `ShiftEventActivity` open), maintaining persona independence, using shared preferences without account-wise counts, and moving app review logic from `HomeActivity` to `AppReviewManager` to enable showing the prompt on any screen.
*   **Specific App Review TODOs:** Immediately showing the prompt upon condition achievement, preventing increment for browser cases in solution articles, and showing the prompt for "seen" events (details incomplete).

**3. Branch-related notes:**
Brief notes indicate unpushed commits related to replacing PNGs with SVGs and updating existing special notifications, along with handling rotation for MDM Browser Config.

**Pattern:**
The recurring pattern is the identical content logged for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` across multiple timestamps. This indicates that while the file state was captured at different times, no actual textual changes were introduced.
