# Activity Summary for 2/16/2026

## 12:13:19 AM
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`. All logged entries, spanning from 2/10/2026, 2:44:43 PM to 2/12/2026, 1:54:53 PM, show identical content, suggesting no actual code modifications were committed or saved between these timestamps, but rather the file was likely opened, viewed, or saved without changes.

The document itself is a "Post Grooming" note covering two main areas:

**1. Notification Burst Logic:**
This section outlines a system to detect a "burst" of notifications, defined as receiving a certain number (`C`) of notifications within a specified time (`T`).
*   It uses a `deque` (double-ended queue) to store notification timestamps.
*   When a new notification arrives, it's compared against the oldest timestamp in the deque.
*   If `C` notifications are received within `T` time, a "special notification" is shown once (`isSpecialNotificationShown` flag prevents repeats). Otherwise, a normal notification is displayed, and the deque might be reset.
*   Example scenarios with `T=15` and `C=3` are provided to illustrate the logic.
*   **Key TODO/Suggestions:** Several improvements are listed, including making special notifications appear more than once, managing their IDs and position, testing for double account IDs, automating notifications, refactoring `prevNotificationTime` to use a list, refining deque reset logic, injecting `gson` into `NotificationBurstConverter`, enhancing special notification display (title, icon, click event), checking count usage, adding setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

**2. App Review and Rating Prompt:**
This section details the logic for displaying an app review prompt.
*   When the prompt is shown, a counter should reset and not increment for the next 90 days.
*   After the 90-day period, incrementing resumes.
*   If the prompt hasn't been shown, the counter continues to increment.
*   **Key TODOs:** Testing the existing app review code, refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
*   **Questions and Answers:** Various implementation and architectural questions are addressed, covering module placement (core module is fine), fixing a double API call for update tasks, asset validity for ticket changes/closures (yes), agent ticket creation, detecting "difference" (don't), data loss on uninstall (not an issue), separate PR for refactoring (yes), identifying on-call users (no need, increment on `ShiftEventActivity` open), maintaining persona independence, using shared preferences without account-wise counts, and moving app review logic from `HomeActivity` to `AppReviewManager` to enable showing the prompt on any screen.
*   **Specific App Review TODOs:** Immediately showing the prompt upon condition achievement, preventing increment for browser cases in solution articles, and showing the prompt for "seen" events (details incomplete).

**3. Branch-related notes:**
Brief notes indicate unpushed commits related to replacing PNGs with SVGs and updating existing special notifications, along with handling rotation for MDM Browser Config.

**Pattern:**
The recurring pattern is the identical content logged for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` across multiple timestamps. This indicates that while the file state was captured at different times, no actual textual changes were introduced.

## 5:22:35 AM
The log details changes to a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`, with multiple entries recorded on 2/10/2026 and 2/12/2026.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The content of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` remains identical across all logged timestamps. This indicates that while the file was accessed or saved multiple times, no actual content modifications were introduced during the period captured by the log. The document serves as a "Post Grooming" markdown, outlining design, logic, and pending tasks for features within the Freshservice application.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
There are no content-specific changes to highlight based on timestamps, as the content is consistently the same across all entries. The timestamps primarily mark moments when the file's state was recorded:
*   **February 10, 2026, around 2:44 PM - 2:45 PM:** A series of closely spaced entries.
*   **February 12, 2026, around 12:11 PM and 1:48 PM - 1:54 PM:** Another series of closely spaced entries, roughly two days after the initial set.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in Content:**
The document consistently covers two main areas:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:**
    *   Detailed explanation of a notification burst detection mechanism using a `deque` (doubly-ended queue).
    *   Defines parameters `T` (time threshold, e.g., 15) and `C` (count threshold, e.g., 3) for identifying a burst.
    *   Outlines how a `special notification` is shown only once per burst, with subsequent burst notifications being discarded or ignored.
    *   Includes example timelines (e.g., T0, T5, T13, T14, T28) to illustrate the logic.
    *   Lists numerous "Todo / suggestions" related to special notifications, such as showing them more than once, managing notification IDs, controlling position, testing for double account IDs, automating notifications, refactoring data structures (replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list), resetting the deque, and displaying account names/icons. It also suggests renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:**
    *   Describes the logic for showing an in-app review prompt.
    *   Specifies rules for resetting and incrementing a counter: resetting after the prompt is shown for 90 days, then resuming incrementing.
    *   Identifies "App Review TODO" items, including testing the current implementation and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   Presents a "Questions" section with "Unanswered" and "Answered" items, covering architectural choices (module placement), API performance (duplicate task API calls), event tracking conditions (adding/changing/closing tickets, agent ticket creation, user on-call status), data handling (uninstall data loss), development workflow (separate PR for refactoring), and user experience (persona independence, using shared preferences, showing prompt on the page where logic is achieved, excluding browser solution articles).

In addition, there are brief notes about ongoing branch work, specifically "Replace png with svg" and "MDM Browser Config - handle rotation". The repeated content across different timestamps implies the document is a continuously evolving internal design and task tracking file, with its stable state being captured by the log at various points.

## 7:08:43 AM
The log details activity within a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`, across multiple timestamps. The first recorded change is on 2/10/2026, 2:44:43 PM, and the latest is on 2/12/2026, 1:54:53 PM.

**File-specific Updates and Patterns:**
The content of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` remains entirely identical across all recorded timestamps. This suggests that the file was either saved multiple times without modifications during this period, or the log captured snapshots of its consistent state at these intervals.

The document itself is a "Post Grooming" note, detailing several key development areas:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:** This section outlines a detailed algorithm for detecting "notification bursts." It uses a deque (double-ended queue) to store notification timestamps and determine if `C` notifications have been received within a `T` time threshold.
    *   It defines rules for displaying normal versus special notifications, including a flag `isSpecialNotificationShown` to ensure the special notification is shown only once per burst event.
    *   Concrete examples with `T=15, C=3` and epoch timestamps are provided to illustrate the burst detection mechanism.

2.  **Notification-related To-Dos/Suggestions:** A list of items to be addressed for notification handling, including:
    *   Allowing special notifications to show multiple times.
    *   Managing notification IDs and controlling their display position (e.g., bottom by default, top using `setSortKey`).
    *   Testing for double account IDs and automating notifications.
    *   Refining the deque/linked list logic for resetting.
    *   Considering `gson` injection for `NotificationBurstConverter`.
    *   Customizing special notification titles (e.g., with account name), attaching to groups, and displaying icons.
    *   Adding click events and reviewing the usage of a "count" variable.
    *   Adding setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`.
    *   Suggesting a rename from `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

3.  **Other Project-related Tasks and Questions:** The document also covers broader development points:
    *   **Branch Activity:** Mentions a pending commit to replace PNGs with SVGs and to update existing special notifications.
    *   **MDM Browser Config:** Notes handling rotation.
    *   **App Review and Rating Prompt:** Describes a logic for managing when the prompt should be shown, including resetting a counter for 90 days after display, and continuous incrementing otherwise.
        *   **App Review To-Dos:** Testing the current implementation, refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
        *   **Questions:** Includes answered and unanswered questions regarding module structure, API call duplication, asset management, user roles (agent/requestor), data persistence on uninstall, PR strategy for refactoring, detecting on-call status, using shared preferences for counts, and prompt display location. Specific follow-up actions like showing the prompt immediately on logic achievement, not incrementing for browser solution articles, and showing for "seen" events are also noted.

## 1:11:34 PM
The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` captures detailed notes and planning related to two distinct features: "Notification Burst" and "App review and Rating Prompt", along with a few other minor development tasks. The log shows multiple entries for this exact file content between 2/10/2026, 2:44:43 PM and 2/12/2026, 1:54:53 PM, indicating that the content of this document remained unchanged or was repeatedly saved/logged during this period.

**File-Specific Updates for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`:**

**1. Notification Burst Logic:**
This section outlines the logic for detecting a "notification burst" using a `deque` (double-ended queue).
*   **Mechanism:** Notifications arrive sequentially (T0, T1, T2, etc.). They are pushed to the front of the deque. A burst is identified if `C` notifications are received within a time window `T`. For example, if `T3 - T0 < T` and `deque.length >= C`, it's a burst.
*   **Special Notification:** A `bool isSpecialNotificationShown` flag ensures that a "special notification" is displayed only once per burst event. Subsequent notifications within the same burst are either discarded or handled differently.
*   **Time and Count Thresholds:** Specific examples are provided with `T = 15` and `C = 3` to illustrate scenarios where notifications are considered a burst or not, based on time differences between elements in the deque. The logic seems to consider the time difference between the *newest* notification and the *oldest* in the `C`-sized window.
*   **TODO / Suggestions:**
    *   Enable showing special notifications more than once.
    *   Determine the notification ID and control the position of special notifications (e.g., `setSortKey` to show on top of a group).
    *   Test for scenarios involving double account IDs.
    *   Explore automation for notifications.
    *   Replace `prevNotificationTime` with a list/deque.
    *   Refine the logic for resetting the deque/linked list.
    *   Investigate injecting Gson into `NotificationBurstConverter`.
    *   Enhance special notifications by displaying the title with the account name, attaching to a group, and showing an icon.
    *   Add a click event for special notifications.
    *   Verify if the "count" is being used anywhere.
    *   Implement setters and getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`.
    *   Consider renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

**2. App Review and Rating Prompt:**
This section details the rules and outstanding tasks for displaying an app review prompt.
*   **Counter Logic:**
    *   When the prompt is shown, its associated counter is reset and should not increment for the next 90 days.
    *   After the 90-day period from the prompt's display, the counter should resume incrementing.
    *   If the prompt has not yet been shown, the counter continues to increment.
*   **App Review TODOs:**
    *   Test the current implementation of the app review code.
    *   Refactor `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
*   **Questions and Answers:**
    *   Module placement: Core module is deemed acceptable.
    *   Duplicate API calls (`update tasks api`): Needs to be fixed.
    *   Asset addition to tickets (changes/closing): Valid for both.
    *   Agent ticket creation: Confirmed as fine.
    *   Detecting "different": Decided against implementing this.
    *   Data loss on uninstall: Not a concern.
    *   Refactoring PR: Recommended as a separate pull request.
    *   On-call user detection: Not required; simply increment when `ShiftEventActivity` is opened.
    *   Persona independence: Maintain this.
    *   Data storage: Use shared preferences; account-wise or unique counts are not needed.
    *   Prompt display: Move logic from `HomeActivity` to `AppReviewManager` to allow showing on any screen where conditions are met, providing context via function arguments.
*   **Additional App Review TODOs:**
    *   Show the prompt immediately on the page where the trigger logic is achieved.
    *   Prevent incrementing for solution articles viewed in a browser context.
    *   For "seen" events, display the prompt when the user... (incomplete thought).

**3. Other Development Notes:**
*   Mention of a branch for "MDM Browser Config - handle rotation".
*   A note about an unpushed commit to replace PNGs with SVGs and update existing special notifications.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The most prominent pattern is the consistent structure within each feature's notes, including a high-level explanation, concrete examples (especially for Notification Burst), followed by structured "Todo / suggestions" and "Questions" sections with both unanswered and answered items. This indicates an ongoing design and development grooming process. The identical content across multiple timestamps implies that this document acts as a static set of requirements and discussion points rather than a live-changing code file during the logged period.

## 2:11:23 PM
The log primarily details activity on a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`. All entries for this file, spanning from 2/10/2026, 2:44:43 PM to 2/12/2026, 1:54:53 PM, show identical content. This suggests that the file was frequently saved or its metadata updated without any actual textual modifications being made across these specific log entries.

The content of the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` file outlines two main areas of discussion and development:

1.  **Notification Burst Feature:**
    *   Describes a logic using a deque (double-ended queue) to detect a "notification burst," defined as `C` notifications received within `T` time.
    *   Details how to handle burst notifications by showing a special notification (once) or discarding subsequent ones within the burst period.
    *   Includes example timestamps and scenarios (`T=15`, `C=3`) to illustrate the burst detection mechanism and its adherence to acceptance criteria.
    *   A section titled "Todo / suggestions" lists various tasks and considerations for the special notification feature, such as showing it multiple times, determining its ID and position, automating notifications, refactoring notification time storage (from `prevNotificationTime` to a list/deque), resetting the deque logic, injecting Gson, displaying titles/icons, adding click events, and renaming related classes/entities.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:**
    *   Outlines the behavioral logic for when an in-app review prompt should be displayed.
    *   Specifies that a counter should reset and not increment for 90 days after the prompt is shown, then resume incrementing. If the prompt hasn't been shown, the counter continues to increment.
    *   Includes "App Review TODOs" like testing the current implementation and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   Lists "Questions" related to the implementation, divided into Unanswered (e.g., module placement, duplicate API calls) and Answered (e.g., asset validity for changes, agent ticket creation, persona independence, use of shared preferences, prompt display context).
    *   Further "todo" items for the app review prompt include showing it immediately upon condition achievement, not incrementing for browser-based solution articles, and showing for "seen" events.

**Recurring Elements:**
The most prominent pattern is the complete duplication of content across all timestamps, indicating no actual code or text changes within the provided log range for this file. The file itself consistently focuses on design and implementation notes for notification management and app feedback mechanics.
