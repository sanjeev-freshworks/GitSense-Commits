# Activity Summary for 2/4/2026

## 1:36:31 PM
The `.vscode/launch.json` file, crucial for VS Code debugging and launching configurations, was logged at two very close timestamps: 1/26/2026, 1:15:53 PM and 1/26/2026, 1:16:00 PM. Across these two entries, the content of the file remained identical, indicating no functional changes were introduced during this period.

The file consistently defines three distinct launch configurations:
1.  **"FS Module Dev"**: Configured to launch `lib/main_dev.dart` within the `apps/fsmodule` directory. It uses `../../config/dev_config.json` for dart defines and runs in `debug` flutterMode.
2.  **"FS Sdk Dev"**: Configured to launch `lib/main.dart` within the `apps/fs_sdk` directory. Similar to the module dev, it uses `../../config/dev_config.json` and additionally sets `environment=development` via a dart define. This also runs in `debug` flutterMode.
3.  **"Golden"**: This configuration is specifically for running/debugging tests. It includes `--update-goldens` and sets `isTesting=true`, suggesting it's used for managing Golden image tests.

A recurring pattern across all configurations is the use of `type: dart` and `codeLens` for integrated run/debug options directly in the editor. Both "Dev" configurations consistently reference `dev_config.json`, highlighting a standard approach for development environment setup.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json` was logged twice, on 1/26/2026, at 1:15:53 PM and again at 1:16:00 PM. The content of the file remained identical across both timestamps, indicating no actual changes were introduced or captured between these two log entries.

The `launch.json` file configures VS Code debugging and launching for a Flutter project. It defines three distinct configurations:

*   **FS Module Dev**: This configuration is for launching the `fsmodule` application in debug mode. It specifies the working directory as `apps/fsmodule` and the entry point as `lib/main_dev.dart`. It uses `--dart-define-from-file=../../config/dev_config.json` to load development-specific configurations.
*   **FS Sdk Dev**: This configuration launches the `fs_sdk` application, also in debug mode. Its working directory is `apps/fs_sdk` and the entry point is `lib/main.dart`. Similar to `FS Module Dev`, it uses `dev_config.json` and additionally defines `environment=development`.
*   **Golden**: This configuration is intended for running Flutter golden tests. It includes arguments `--update-goldens` and `--dart-define=isTesting=true`, suggesting it's used to update golden test files or run tests with a testing flag.

A recurring pattern across the development configurations is the use of `flutterMode: "debug"` and `codeLens` definitions to provide convenient debug/run options within the editor. The project structure appears to be a monorepo or multi-package setup, with separate "apps" directories (`fsmodule`, `fs_sdk`) and a shared `config/dev_config.json`.
