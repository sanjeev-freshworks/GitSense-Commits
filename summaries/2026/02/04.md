# Activity Summary for 2/4/2026

## 1:36:31 PM
The `.vscode/launch.json` file, crucial for VS Code debugging and launching configurations, was logged at two very close timestamps: 1/26/2026, 1:15:53 PM and 1/26/2026, 1:16:00 PM. Across these two entries, the content of the file remained identical, indicating no functional changes were introduced during this period.

The file consistently defines three distinct launch configurations:
1.  **"FS Module Dev"**: Configured to launch `lib/main_dev.dart` within the `apps/fsmodule` directory. It uses `../../config/dev_config.json` for dart defines and runs in `debug` flutterMode.
2.  **"FS Sdk Dev"**: Configured to launch `lib/main.dart` within the `apps/fs_sdk` directory. Similar to the module dev, it uses `../../config/dev_config.json` and additionally sets `environment=development` via a dart define. This also runs in `debug` flutterMode.
3.  **"Golden"**: This configuration is specifically for running/debugging tests. It includes `--update-goldens` and sets `isTesting=true`, suggesting it's used for managing Golden image tests.

A recurring pattern across all configurations is the use of `type: dart` and `codeLens` for integrated run/debug options directly in the editor. Both "Dev" configurations consistently reference `dev_config.json`, highlighting a standard approach for development environment setup.
