# Activity Summary for 2/28/2026

## 1:01:46 AM
The provided logs detail a series of changes made on 2/27/2026 across two specific files within the `support_portal` feature of the `mobile_flutter_freshservice` project.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/form/fields/requester/model/form_requester_field_ui_data.dart`**
    *   This file defines the `FormRequesterFieldUIData` class, which handles requester-related form data, mapping user email and ID to domain models for form fields. It includes methods for value retrieval, condition validation, copying, and equality checks.
    *   **Timestamp 2/27/2026, 12:31:32 PM:** A comment containing a specific Freshservice API URL (`https://freshworkshelpdesk276.freshservice.com/api/...`) related to business rules was added.
    *   **Timestamp 2/27/2026, 6:06:06 PM:** Both the newly added comment and an existing older comment (another Freshservice URL) were removed.
    *   The core functionality and structure of the `FormRequesterFieldUIData` class remained unchanged throughout these updates; only comments were modified.

2.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/form/businessrule/condition/validator/user/br_current_user_condition_validator.dart`**
    *   This file defines the `BRCurrentUserConditionValidator` abstract class, which is responsible for validating business rule conditions against current user details. It utilizes `BRCurrentUserConditionValidatorInput` to encapsulate the condition and user data for validation.
    *   **Timestamp 2/27/2026, 6:31:30 PM:** An import for `package:user_lib/user_lib.dart` was added.
    *   **Timestamps 2/27/2026, 6:35:31 PM and 2/27/2026, 6:35:37 PM:** No functional or structural changes were observed in these entries; they appear to be re-saves or minor formatting adjustments.
    *   **Timestamp 2/27/2026, 6:36:01 PM:** A significant change occurred where the type of the `user` field in the `BRCurrentUserConditionValidatorInput` class was updated from `BRUserInfo` to `UserDetail`. This indicates a refinement in the specific user data model used for business rule validation.
    *   **Timestamp 2/27/2026, 7:59:19 PM:** The previously added import for `package:user_lib/user_lib.dart` was removed, suggesting that the `UserDetail` type is sourced from another existing import (`support_portal/src/data/model/user/me/user_detail.dart`) or is otherwise implicitly available.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   All logged changes occurred on the same day, February 27, 2026, indicating focused development or a series of rapid iterations on related features.
*   The changes are concentrated on form handling and business rule validation, specifically concerning how user-related data is processed and validated within the `support_portal` feature.
*   There's a pattern of dependency management adjustments (adding and removing imports) and type refinement (`BRUserInfo` to `UserDetail`), suggesting an ongoing process of code cleanup, refactoring, or adapting to updated data models.
*   The modifications include both cosmetic changes (adding/removing comments) and functional adjustments (type changes), which is typical for active development cycles.

## 3:58:26 AM
The log details changes across two distinct files on February 27, 2026.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/form/fields/requester/model/form_requester_field_ui_data.dart`**

This file defines the `FormRequesterFieldUIData` class, which handles requester information within forms, including properties for the requester's `FSUserUIModel` and `workspaceId`. It also implements methods for form data handling such as `getDomainModels` (to extract requester email and ID), `getFieldValueForConditionValidation`, and `getFieldValueForBRValidation` (both returning the requester's email).

*   **2/27/2026, 12:31:32 PM**: A new commented URL reference related to business rules and service requests was added to the code.
*   **2/27/2026, 6:06:06 PM**: Both commented URLs, including the one added earlier, were removed from the file.
The functional code for the `FormRequesterFieldUIData` class remained unchanged throughout these modifications.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/form/businessrule/condition/validator/user/br_current_user_condition_validator.dart`**

This file outlines the `BRCurrentUserConditionValidator` abstract class and its associated input class `BRCurrentUserConditionValidatorInput`, designed to validate business rule conditions against current user details.

*   **2/27/2026, 6:31:30 PM**: An import statement for `'package:user_lib/user_lib.dart'` was added.
*   **2/27/2026, 6:36:01 PM**: The type of the `user` property within the `BRCurrentUserConditionValidatorInput` class was updated from `BRUserInfo` to `UserDetail`.
*   **2/27/2026, 7:59:19 PM**: The previously added import statement for `'package:user_lib/user_lib.dart'` was removed.
There were also several intermediate timestamps (6:35:31 PM and 6:35:37 PM) where no visible code changes occurred, possibly indicating saves or minor formatting adjustments.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
All changes occurred on the same day, February 27, 2026, suggesting concentrated development or refactoring efforts. The modifications include both cosmetic changes (adding/removing comments) and structural changes (modifying imports and class property types), pointing towards an iterative development process to align with new library dependencies or data models. The repeated addition and removal of an import statement, along with type changes, indicates active refactoring within the `support_portal` feature.

## 5:24:21 AM
The log details changes to a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`. All five entries for this file, timestamped between `2/27/2026, 11:41:45 AM` and `2/27/2026, 11:42:23 AM`, contain identical content. This suggests a series of saves or minor, non-textual modifications within a very short period, rather than substantive content changes between these specific log entries.

The content of the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` file primarily outlines two distinct feature discussions:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic**: This section details an algorithm for detecting a "notification burst" using a deque. The logic involves parameters `T` (time threshold) and `C` (number of notifications). Notifications are added to the front of the deque, and older notifications are popped from the back. A burst is identified if `C` notifications are received within `T` time. The document outlines how a `isSpecialNotificationShown` flag is used to manage the display of a "special notification" (showing it once per burst or discarding subsequent ones). Several examples with specific timestamps (`T0`, `T5`, `T13`, etc.) are provided to illustrate the flow and burst detection criteria.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt Logic**: This section specifies the conditions and behavior for displaying an app review prompt. Key rules include:
    *   Resetting a counter for 90 days after the prompt is shown, preventing further increments during this period.
    *   Resuming counter increments once the 90-day period expires.
    *   Continuing to increment the counter if the prompt has not yet been shown.
    *   A "TODO" list for app review suggests testing the current implementation, refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   A "Questions" section with both unanswered and answered points covers topics like module structure, duplicate API calls, asset addition validity, agent ticket creation, detecting "differences," data loss on uninstall, GitHub PR strategy, user on-call status, use of shared preferences (persona-independent, non-account-wise counts), and the display location for the prompt (moving logic from `HomeActivity` to `AppReviewManager`).
    *   Additional "todo" items include immediately showing the prompt when logic is achieved, not incrementing for browser-based solution articles, and showing for "seen" events.

**General Todo / Suggestions**: The document also includes a mixed list of "Todo / suggestions" related to notification features, such as:
*   Improving special notification handling (showing more than once, ID, position control, icon display, click events).
*   Addressing double account IDs and automating notifications.
*   Refining deque/linked list logic (resetting, replacing `prevNotificationTime`).
*   Exploring Gson injection in `NotificationBurstConverter`.
*   Displaying title with account name for special notifications.
*   Adding setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`.
*   Suggesting renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

**Branch Notes**: There are also brief notes on pending branch commits related to replacing PNGs with SVGs and updating existing special notifications, along with "MDM Browser Config - handle rotation".
