# Activity Summary for 2/2/2026

## 8:42:48 AM
The log primarily details changes to the VS Code launch configuration file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json`**: This file defines three distinct launch configurations for a Flutter project:
    *   **"FS Module Dev"**: Configured to launch a Flutter module located at `${workspaceFolder}/apps/fsmodule`, specifically executing `lib/main_dev.dart`. It passes arguments to load dart defines from `../../config/dev_config.json` and runs in `debug` mode. CodeLens is set up for running and debugging this file.
    *   **"FS Sdk Dev"**: Configured to launch a Flutter SDK application located at `${workspaceFolder}/apps/fs_sdk`, executing `lib/main.dart`. Similar to the module dev setup, it loads dart defines from `../../config/dev_config.json` and additionally defines `environment=development`. It also runs in `debug` mode with CodeLens for file execution.
    *   **"Golden"**: This configuration is for running Golden tests, including `--update-goldens` and `--dart-define=isTesting=true` arguments. CodeLens supports various test execution options like `run-test` and `debug-test`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   Two entries for the `launch.json` file were recorded at **1/26/2026, 1:15:53 PM** and **1/26/2026, 1:16:00 PM**.
*   Notably, the content of the `launch.json` file is identical across both timestamps. This indicates that no functional code changes were introduced into the file between these two recorded moments, despite the file being touched or saved twice within a short 7-second interval.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   All configurations are of `type: "dart"`, indicating a Flutter/Dart project context.
*   Development configurations ("FS Module Dev" and "FS Sdk Dev") consistently utilize `--dart-define-from-file=../../config/dev_config.json` to manage environment-specific variables, promoting a clear separation of configuration.
*   Both development configurations are set to `flutterMode: "debug"`.
*   The `codeLens` property is consistently used across all configurations to provide convenient launch/debug options directly in the VS Code editor.

## 1:58:11 PM
The log details two consecutive entries for the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json`.

**File-specific updates:**
Despite two separate log entries with different timestamps, the content of the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json` file remained identical across both records. This indicates no functional or structural changes were applied to the VS Code launch configurations between the recorded timestamps.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
The two entries are timestamped 1/26/2026, 1:15:53 PM and 1/26/2026, 1:16:00 PM. These are seven seconds apart, suggesting either a rapid series of saves without content modification or log entries generated for identical content within a very short timeframe.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**
The `launch.json` file configures VS Code debugging for a Flutter project, defining three distinct launch configurations:
*   **"FS Module Dev"**: Targets `apps/fsmodule/lib/main_dev.dart` and loads configuration from `../../config/dev_config.json`.
*   **"FS Sdk Dev"**: Targets `apps/fs_sdk/lib/main.dart` and also uses `../../config/dev_config.json`, additionally defining `environment=development`.
*   **"Golden"**: Configured for running tests with `--update-goldens` and `isTesting=true`.

All configurations are of `type: "dart"`, `request: "launch"`, and use `flutterMode: "debug"` (where applicable for app launches). They consistently utilize `codeLens` for easier debugging/running directly from the editor, displaying titles like "${debugType} (dev)" or "${debugType} (golden)". The use of `dart-define-from-file` and `--dart-define` is a recurring pattern for injecting environment-specific or testing-specific arguments into the Flutter/Dart applications.

## 2:58:43 PM
The log primarily details changes to a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json`.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json:** This file configures VS Code launch settings for a Flutter project. It defines three distinct launch configurations:
    1.  **"FS Module Dev"**: Designed for debugging the `fsmodule` application, it launches `lib/main_dev.dart` and loads configuration from `../../config/dev_config.json`.
    2.  **"FS Sdk Dev"**: Configured for debugging the `fs_sdk` application, it launches `lib/main.dart`, also loading `../../config/dev_config.json`, and explicitly sets `environment=development`.
    3.  **"Golden"**: A testing configuration for running or debugging golden tests, including arguments to `--update-goldens` and set `--dart-define=isTesting=true`.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

The file was logged at 1/26/2026, 1:15:53 PM and again at 1/26/2026, 1:16:00 PM. The content of the file is identical across both timestamps, indicating no functional change occurred between these two log entries.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   All configurations utilize `type: dart` and `request: launch`, common for Flutter/Dart development.
*   Environment-specific configurations are handled using `--dart-define-from-file` (referencing `dev_config.json`) and `--dart-define` arguments, specifically for development environments and testing flags.
*   The project structure appears to be a monorepo or includes multiple Flutter applications/packages, as indicated by configurations for both `fsmodule` and `fs_sdk`.
*   CodeLens configurations are consistently used to provide quick debug/run options within the IDE for specific files or test types.
