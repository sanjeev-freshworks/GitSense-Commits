# Activity Summary for 2/2/2026

## 8:42:48 AM
The log primarily details changes to the VS Code launch configuration file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json`**: This file defines three distinct launch configurations for a Flutter project:
    *   **"FS Module Dev"**: Configured to launch a Flutter module located at `${workspaceFolder}/apps/fsmodule`, specifically executing `lib/main_dev.dart`. It passes arguments to load dart defines from `../../config/dev_config.json` and runs in `debug` mode. CodeLens is set up for running and debugging this file.
    *   **"FS Sdk Dev"**: Configured to launch a Flutter SDK application located at `${workspaceFolder}/apps/fs_sdk`, executing `lib/main.dart`. Similar to the module dev setup, it loads dart defines from `../../config/dev_config.json` and additionally defines `environment=development`. It also runs in `debug` mode with CodeLens for file execution.
    *   **"Golden"**: This configuration is for running Golden tests, including `--update-goldens` and `--dart-define=isTesting=true` arguments. CodeLens supports various test execution options like `run-test` and `debug-test`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   Two entries for the `launch.json` file were recorded at **1/26/2026, 1:15:53 PM** and **1/26/2026, 1:16:00 PM**.
*   Notably, the content of the `launch.json` file is identical across both timestamps. This indicates that no functional code changes were introduced into the file between these two recorded moments, despite the file being touched or saved twice within a short 7-second interval.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   All configurations are of `type: "dart"`, indicating a Flutter/Dart project context.
*   Development configurations ("FS Module Dev" and "FS Sdk Dev") consistently utilize `--dart-define-from-file=../../config/dev_config.json` to manage environment-specific variables, promoting a clear separation of configuration.
*   Both development configurations are set to `flutterMode: "debug"`.
*   The `codeLens` property is consistently used across all configurations to provide convenient launch/debug options directly in the VS Code editor.
