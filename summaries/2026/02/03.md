# Activity Summary for 2/3/2026

## 2:06:28 AM
The log primarily features updates to a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json`.

The file at `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json` was logged at `1/26/2026, 1:15:53 PM` and again at `1/26/2026, 1:16:00 PM`. The content of the file remained identical across both timestamps, indicating no actual code changes occurred between these log entries.

This `launch.json` file defines VS Code debug configurations for a Flutter project. It contains three main configurations:
1.  **"FS Module Dev"**: Configured to launch the `fsmodule` application in debug mode (`lib/main_dev.dart`). It uses a `dev_config.json` file for dart defines.
2.  **"FS Sdk Dev"**: Configured to launch the `fs_sdk` application in debug mode (`lib/main.dart`). Similar to "FS Module Dev", it uses `dev_config.json` and additionally defines `environment=development`.
3.  **"Golden"**: This configuration is specifically for running Dart tests, likely golden tests, as it includes arguments such as `--update-goldens` and sets `--dart-define=isTesting=true`.

A recurring pattern across the "FS Module Dev" and "FS Sdk Dev" configurations is the use of `flutterMode: "debug"` and `codeLens` definitions for running and debugging specific files. Both development configurations also consistently reference `../../config/dev_config.json` for environment-specific settings.

The log details changes to a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json`.

The content of this `launch.json` file appears identical across two log entries, recorded at `1/26/2026, 1:15:53 PM` and `1/26/2026, 1:16:00 PM`. This suggests no actual content modification occurred between these timestamps, or the changes were reverted.

The `launch.json` file defines three VS Code debug configurations for a Flutter project:

1.  **"FS Module Dev"**: Configured to launch `lib/main_dev.dart` within the `apps/fsmodule` directory in debug mode. It consistently uses arguments from `../../config/dev_config.json`.
2.  **"FS Sdk Dev"**: Configured to launch `lib/main.dart` within the `apps/fs_sdk` directory in debug mode. Similar to "FS Module Dev", it uses `../../config/dev_config.json` and additionally defines `environment=development`.
3.  **"Golden"**: This configuration is set up for running or debugging tests, specifically including arguments `--update-goldens` and `--dart-define=isTesting=true`, indicating its use for golden snapshot testing.

A common pattern across the development configurations is the reliance on `../../config/dev_config.json` for environment-specific `dart-define` arguments, and all configurations are of `type: "dart"`.
