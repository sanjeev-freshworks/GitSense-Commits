# Activity Summary for 2/15/2026

## 2:26:49 PM
The provided logs exclusively track changes to a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`.

**File-specific updates for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`:**
The content of this markdown file remained identical across all recorded timestamps, suggesting a continuous working session with frequent saves rather than distinct content modifications between the log entries. The file serves as a detailed grooming document for two main features:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:** This section outlines an algorithm for detecting a "burst" of notifications, defined as receiving `C` notifications within a time window `T`. It uses a deque (doubly-ended queue) to manage notification timestamps (`T0, T1, T2...`).
    *   The logic details how notifications are pushed to the front of the deque and how a burst is identified by comparing the timestamp of a new notification with the oldest one in the deque.
    *   It specifies handling for showing a "special notification" only once per burst, or discarding subsequent notifications within the same burst.
    *   Examples are provided (`T=15, C=3`) to illustrate how sequences of notification timestamps would be processed and whether they constitute a burst.
    *   **Todo/Suggestions** for this feature include: showing special notifications multiple times, determining notification IDs and positioning, testing for double account IDs, automating notifications, replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list, refining deque reset logic, injecting GSON in `NotificationBurstConverter`, displaying titles with account names, adding click events, checking count usage, showing icons, adding setters/getters in `ListNotificationViewModel`, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.
    *   A brief mention of a branch activity to "Replace png with svg" and "Replace/Update existing special notification" is also present.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:** This section defines the logic for displaying an app review prompt.
    *   The counter for showing the prompt should reset when the prompt is shown and should not increment for the next 90 days.
    *   After the 90-day period, the counter resumes incrementing.
    *   If the prompt has not yet been shown, the counter continues to increment.
    *   **App Review TODOs** include testing the current implementation and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   A list of **Questions** and their **Answers** covers topics such as: module placement (core module is fine), fixing duplicate API calls for update tasks (should fix), validity of adding assets to tickets for changes/closing (yes), agent ticket creation (fine), detecting "different" (don't), data loss on uninstall (not a problem), creating separate PRs for refactoring (yes), recognizing on-call status (no need, just increment when `ShiftEventActivity` is opened), maintaining persona independence and using shared preferences for counts (no need for account-wise/unique counts).
    *   Additional **todo** items for the app review prompt are: immediately showing it on the page where the logic is achieved, not incrementing for browser cases in solution articles, and showing the prompt for "seen" events when the user meets conditions.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
The file was actively saved or updated across two days:
*   **February 10, 2026:** Multiple saves occurred between 2:44:43 PM and 2:45:28 PM.
*   **February 12, 2026:** Further saves were recorded between 12:11:43 PM and 1:54:53 PM, spanning over an hour and a half of activity.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**
The content consistently addresses grooming and planning aspects for application features. Both major sections (Notification Burst and App Review) follow a similar structure: defining logic, providing examples or criteria, listing "Todo / suggestions," and including a "Questions" section with answers. This suggests a structured approach to feature development and discussion. The frequent, near-identical log entries indicate a practice of regular saving during development or discussion of a static document.
