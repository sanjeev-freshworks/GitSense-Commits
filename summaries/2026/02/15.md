# Activity Summary for 2/15/2026

## 2:26:49 PM
The provided logs exclusively track changes to a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`.

**File-specific updates for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`:**
The content of this markdown file remained identical across all recorded timestamps, suggesting a continuous working session with frequent saves rather than distinct content modifications between the log entries. The file serves as a detailed grooming document for two main features:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:** This section outlines an algorithm for detecting a "burst" of notifications, defined as receiving `C` notifications within a time window `T`. It uses a deque (doubly-ended queue) to manage notification timestamps (`T0, T1, T2...`).
    *   The logic details how notifications are pushed to the front of the deque and how a burst is identified by comparing the timestamp of a new notification with the oldest one in the deque.
    *   It specifies handling for showing a "special notification" only once per burst, or discarding subsequent notifications within the same burst.
    *   Examples are provided (`T=15, C=3`) to illustrate how sequences of notification timestamps would be processed and whether they constitute a burst.
    *   **Todo/Suggestions** for this feature include: showing special notifications multiple times, determining notification IDs and positioning, testing for double account IDs, automating notifications, replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list, refining deque reset logic, injecting GSON in `NotificationBurstConverter`, displaying titles with account names, adding click events, checking count usage, showing icons, adding setters/getters in `ListNotificationViewModel`, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.
    *   A brief mention of a branch activity to "Replace png with svg" and "Replace/Update existing special notification" is also present.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:** This section defines the logic for displaying an app review prompt.
    *   The counter for showing the prompt should reset when the prompt is shown and should not increment for the next 90 days.
    *   After the 90-day period, the counter resumes incrementing.
    *   If the prompt has not yet been shown, the counter continues to increment.
    *   **App Review TODOs** include testing the current implementation and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   A list of **Questions** and their **Answers** covers topics such as: module placement (core module is fine), fixing duplicate API calls for update tasks (should fix), validity of adding assets to tickets for changes/closing (yes), agent ticket creation (fine), detecting "different" (don't), data loss on uninstall (not a problem), creating separate PRs for refactoring (yes), recognizing on-call status (no need, just increment when `ShiftEventActivity` is opened), maintaining persona independence and using shared preferences for counts (no need for account-wise/unique counts).
    *   Additional **todo** items for the app review prompt are: immediately showing it on the page where the logic is achieved, not incrementing for browser cases in solution articles, and showing the prompt for "seen" events when the user meets conditions.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
The file was actively saved or updated across two days:
*   **February 10, 2026:** Multiple saves occurred between 2:44:43 PM and 2:45:28 PM.
*   **February 12, 2026:** Further saves were recorded between 12:11:43 PM and 1:54:53 PM, spanning over an hour and a half of activity.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**
The content consistently addresses grooming and planning aspects for application features. Both major sections (Notification Burst and App Review) follow a similar structure: defining logic, providing examples or criteria, listing "Todo / suggestions," and including a "Questions" section with answers. This suggests a structured approach to feature development and discussion. The frequent, near-identical log entries indicate a practice of regular saving during development or discussion of a static document.

The provided log details changes to a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`.

**File-specific Updates & Timestamps:**

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` was frequently updated over two days, starting on February 10, 2026, at 2:44:43 PM and continuing until February 12, 2026, at 1:54:53 PM. Despite the numerous timestamps, the content of the file remained identical across all logged entries. This indicates a period of focused documentation or ideation, with frequent saving of the same state of the document.

**Summary of Content:**

The document outlines post-grooming notes and specifications for several features, primarily focusing on:

1.  **Notification Burst Mechanism:**
    *   Describes a system to detect "notification bursts" where `C` notifications are received within `T` time, using a deque (double-ended queue) data structure.
    *   Details the logic for pushing new notifications to the front, popping old ones from the back, and comparing timestamps (`T3 - T0 < T`) to identify a burst.
    *   Includes examples with specific timestamps (`T0 = 100, T5 = 105, T13 = 113, T14 = 114, T28 = 128` with `T=15, C=3`) to illustrate how a special notification is triggered or notifications are discarded/handled normally.
    *   States the acceptance criteria: "Special Notification should be shown when we receive C notifications within T time."
    *   Lists extensive "Todo / suggestions" related to special notifications, such as displaying it more than once, managing its ID and position (e.g., using `setSortKey`), testing for double account IDs, automating notifications, refining deque reset logic, `gson` injection, displaying title with account name, showing an icon, adding click events, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.
    *   Mentions adding setters and getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`.

2.  **Branch-Related Notes:**
    *   Briefly notes "Replace png with svg commit is not pushed yet" and "Replace/Update existing special notification."

3.  **MDM Browser Config:**
    *   Mentions a task to "handle rotation."

4.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:**
    *   Defines the logic for the app review prompt: resetting a counter when the prompt is shown, not incrementing for the next 90 days, and incrementing again after 90 days or if the prompt hasn't been shown.
    *   Lists "App Review TODOs": testing the current code, refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   Documents "Questions" and their "Answered" status, covering topics like:
        *   Module placement (core module is fine).
        *   Fixing the `update tasks api` being called twice (unanswered).
        *   Adding assets to tickets (valid for changes/closing).
        *   Agent ability to create tickets (fine).
        *   Detecting "different" (don't).
        *   Data loss on uninstall (not a problem).
        *   Separate PR for refactoring (yes, based on Vasanth's review).
        *   Recognizing an on-call user (no need, increment on `ShiftEventActivity` open).
        *   Keeping it persona-independent and using shared preferences for counts.
        *   Requirement to show the prompt on any screen when conditions are true (move code from `HomeActivity` to `AppReviewManager`).
    *   Additional "todo" items for App Review: showing immediately on logic achievement, not incrementing for solution articles in browser, and showing the prompt for "seen" events.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The most prominent pattern is the detailed breakdown of feature requirements, followed by extensive lists of TODOs and questions with answers, indicating a thorough grooming and planning phase. The identical content across many timestamps suggests a single, comprehensive documentation effort that was frequently saved rather than an iterative change in the content itself within this log. The recurring themes across the features are notification handling, state management (e.g., `isSpecialNotificationShown`, prompt counter), and UI/UX considerations for special notifications and prompts.

## 4:29:42 PM
The log details changes to a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`, across multiple timestamps on **February 10, 2026**, and **February 12, 2026**.

The content of the file is identical across all recorded timestamps, indicating that these entries represent multiple saves or logging events of the same file state, rather than incremental code changes.

The file itself is a "Post Grooming" document outlining various development concerns and plans, primarily covering three distinct areas:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:**
    *   A detailed algorithm is described using a `deque` (double-ended queue) to manage notifications and detect "bursts".
    *   A burst is defined by receiving `C` notifications within a `T` time threshold (e.g., T=15, C=3).
    *   The logic involves pushing new notifications to the front of the deque and checking the time difference between the newest and oldest notifications once the deque reaches size `C`.
    *   A `isSpecialNotificationShown` flag ensures a special notification is shown only once per burst, with subsequent notifications in the same burst being discarded.
    *   If the time threshold is exceeded, the burst is reset, and normal notifications are shown.
    *   Several examples and test cases are provided to illustrate the burst detection and handling.

2.  **To-Do / Suggestions related to Notifications:**
    *   Consider showing special notifications more than once.
    *   Determine the notification ID and control the position of special notifications (currently defaults to bottom but can be moved to top with `setSortKey`).
    *   Test for double account IDs and automate notifications.
    *   Replace `prevNotificationTime` with a list/deque for better tracking.
    *   Refine the logic for resetting the deque.
    *   Explore injecting `gson` into `NotificationBurstConverter`.
    *   Enhance special notifications with account names, group attachment, and click events, along with ensuring icons are displayed.
    *   Add setters and getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`.
    *   Suggest renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

3.  **Other Project Updates and Questions:**
    *   **Branch-specific tasks:** Replace PNGs with SVGs (commit not yet pushed), and update existing special notifications.
    *   **MDM Browser Config:** Focus on handling rotation.
    *   **App Review and Rating Prompt:**
        *   Detailed logic for managing the prompt counter: reset and no increment for 90 days after display, incrementing after 90 days, and continuous incrementing if not yet shown.
        *   **App Review TODOs:** Test existing app review code and refactor `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   **Questions & Answers:** A list of discussion points and their resolutions:
        *   Module separation: Core module is acceptable.
        *   Duplicate `update tasks api` call: Needs fixing.
        *   Asset addition validity for ticket changes/closing: Confirmed as "yes".
        *   Agent ticket creation: Confirmed as "fine".
        *   Detecting "different": Decided against.
        *   Data loss on uninstall: Not a concern.
        *   Refactoring PR strategy: Separate PR recommended.
        *   User on-call detection: Not required (increment when `ShiftEventActivity` opens).
        *   Persona independence and counts: Use shared preferences, no account-wise unique counts.
        *   App review prompt display: Logic should be moved from `HomeActivity` to `AppReviewManager` to allow display on any relevant screen.
        *   **Specific App Review `todo` actions:** Show prompt immediately when logic is met, do not increment for solution articles viewed in browser, and show the prompt for "seen" events.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The document consistently uses bullet points for lists of todos, suggestions, and questions/answers. The `*-` prefix is used for new or pending action items. The structure clearly separates technical implementation details (like the deque logic) from product features (like app review prompts) and general development questions. The repetitive nature of the log entries for the same file suggests the "Post Grooming.md" file is a central document for tracking ongoing work and discussions.

## 11:12:20 PM
The provided log details multiple entries for a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`, with timestamps ranging from February 10, 2026, 2:44:43 PM to February 12, 2026, 1:54:53 PM. Notably, the content of this file remains identical across all recorded timestamps, suggesting repeated saves or a continuous working session on the same document rather than incremental changes captured in the log.

The document itself outlines discussions and plans for two distinct features within a Freshservice application:

**1. Notification Burst Logic:**
This section details a proposed mechanism for handling "burst" notifications, defined as receiving `C` notifications within a `T` time threshold.
*   **Mechanism:** It describes using a deque (`back[]front`) to store notification timestamps. New notifications (`T0`, `T1`, `T2`, etc.) are added, and if the deque reaches `C` length and the time difference between the current notification and the oldest (`T3 - T0` or `T4 - T1`) is less than `T`, it triggers a "burst" condition.
*   **Special Notification:** A `bool isSpecialNotificationShown` flag is used to ensure a "special notification" is shown only once per burst, or if it's already shown, subsequent burst notifications are discarded. If the time threshold is exceeded, the deque is cleared, and normal notifications resume.
*   **Examples:** Concrete examples with `T = 15` and `C = 3` are provided to illustrate the burst detection logic, including specific epoch timestamps.
*   **Todo/Suggestions:** A comprehensive list of tasks and considerations for this feature includes: showing special notifications multiple times, defining notification IDs and controlling their position, testing for double account IDs, automating notifications, replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list (as designed), refining deque reset logic, injecting `gson`, displaying account names in special notification titles, adding click events, checking count usage, implementing setters/getters in `ListNotificationViewModel`, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

**2. App Review and Rating Prompt:**
This section outlines the behavior and implementation considerations for an in-app review prompt.
*   **Prompt Logic:** The counter for showing the prompt should reset and not increment for 90 days after the prompt is shown. After 90 days, incrementing resumes. If the prompt has never been shown, incrementing continues.
*   **Todo Items:** Key development tasks include: testing the current app review code, and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore` classes.
*   **Questions and Answers:** Various architectural and implementation questions are posed and some have been answered:
    *   Module placement (keeping in core module is fine).
    *   Duplicate API calls for update tasks (should be fixed).
    *   Asset addition validity for changes/closing tickets (yes).
    *   Agent ticket creation (fine).
    *   Detecting "different" (don't).
    *   Data loss on uninstall (not an issue).
    *   Separate PR for refactoring (yes, as per Vasanth's review).
    *   Recognizing user on-call status (no need, increment on `ShiftEventActivity` open).
    *   Persona independence and using shared preferences (no need for account-wise/unique counts).
    *   Prompt display on any screen (move logic to `AppReviewManager`).
*   **Final Todo:** Additional tasks include immediately showing the prompt on the page where the logic condition is met, not incrementing for browser-based solution articles, and showing the prompt for "seen" events.

**Overall Patterns:**
The document serves as a detailed "post-grooming" artifact, meticulously documenting functional specifications, pseudo-code logic, test cases, and a comprehensive list of technical and product-related "todos" and "questions" for Android feature development. The consistency of the content across multiple timestamps highlights its role as a static reference or a summary of a completed discussion, continuously saved without alteration during the logged period.
