# Activity Summary for 2/17/2026

## 12:38:52 AM
The log details changes within a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`. The entries span from 2/10/2026, 2:44:43 PM to 2/12/2026, 1:54:53 PM. Despite multiple timestamps, the content of this markdown file remains identical across all entries, suggesting either multiple saves without content alteration or a log of access rather than modification.

The file itself serves as a grooming document, outlining design and implementation considerations for two primary features:

**1. Notification Burst Logic:**
This section details a mechanism to detect and handle "bursts" of notifications.
*   It proposes using a deque (`back[]front`) to store recent notification timestamps.
*   A burst is defined as receiving `C` notifications within a `T` time threshold.
*   The logic describes how to process incoming notifications (`T0`, `T1`, `T2`, etc.):
    *   If the deque length is less than `C`, it's not a burst, and normal notifications are shown.
    *   Once `C` notifications are in the deque, subsequent notifications are compared against the oldest timestamp in the deque.
    *   If `(current_notification_time - oldest_notification_time) < T`, it's considered a burst.
    *   During a burst, a `special notification` is shown (only once if `isSpecialNotificationShown` is false); otherwise, the notification is discarded. The deque is updated by popping the oldest and pushing the new one.
    *   If the time threshold `T` is exceeded, it's not a burst, a normal notification is shown, and the deque is reset or re-initialized with the new notification.
*   Examples with specific epoch times (e.g., `T=15`, `C=3`) are provided to illustrate burst detection scenarios, including edge cases.
*   **Recurring elements:** A structured "Todo / suggestions" list for the notification feature covers various aspects:
    *   Handling the display frequency and positioning of special notifications.
    *   Testing for edge cases like double account IDs and automating notification tests.
    *   Refining the underlying data structure (replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list/deque and resetting logic).
    *   Technical considerations like injecting `gson` in `NotificationBurstConverter`.
    *   UI/UX elements such as displaying titles with account names, showing icons, and adding click events.
    *   API/ViewModel updates, specifically adding setters and getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`.
    *   Suggestions for renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

**2. App Review and Rating Prompt:**
This section outlines the logic for displaying an in-app review prompt.
*   The core logic dictates resetting a counter when the prompt is shown, preventing further increments for 90 days.
*   After the 90-day period, the counter resumes incrementing.
*   If the prompt has not yet been shown, the counter continues to increment.
*   **Recurring elements:** A "TODO" list for app review focuses on:
    *   Verifying existing code functionality.
    *   Refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore` classes.
*   **Recurring elements:** A "Questions" section, divided into "Unanswered" and "Answered," addresses architectural and implementation details:
    *   **Unanswered:** Module separation, fixing duplicate API calls (`update tasks api`).
    *   **Answered:** Clarifications on asset addition to tickets (valid for changes/closing), agent ticket creation, detecting "different" events (don't), data persistence on uninstall (not a problem), creating separate PRs for refactoring (yes), recognizing on-call users (increment on `ShiftEventActivity` open), and using shared preferences for persona-independent counts.
    *   A final "todo" list for app review provides specific trigger conditions: showing immediately when logic is achieved, avoiding increment for browser-based solution articles, and showing for "seen" events (though the sentence is incomplete).

**General Patterns:**
The document consistently uses markdown headings and bullet points to structure information. It frequently shifts between conceptual design, specific implementation details (e.g., deque operations, ViewModel properties), and practical considerations like testing and refactoring. There's a clear pattern of listing "Todo/suggestions" or "Questions" for each major feature, indicating ongoing development and refinement discussions. Mention of branches ("Replace png with svg commit is not pushed yet", "Replace/Update existing special notification") suggests ongoing code changes outside the scope of this detailed log entry.

## 2:07:16 AM
The log details continuous work and discussions related to two primary feature areas within a mobile application, recorded in the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`. The timestamps, spanning from February 10, 2026, to February 12, 2026, indicate multiple save points for the same content, suggesting an iterative refinement or documentation process without significant content alterations between saves.

Key information from the file includes:

*   **Notification Burst Logic:** A detailed pseudo-code outlining a mechanism to detect and handle "notification bursts." This involves using a deque to track recent notification timestamps (`T0, T1, ...`) and a boolean flag (`isSpecialNotificationShown`) to manage special notifications. A burst is defined by `C` notifications received within `T` time. The logic specifies showing a special notification once per burst, otherwise displaying normal notifications or discarding redundant ones. Examples are provided to illustrate burst conditions with specific timestamps (e.g., T=15, C=3).
*   **Notification Burst To-Dos/Suggestions:** A list of items for future work or consideration related to notification bursts, such as:
    *   Allowing special notifications to show more than once.
    *   Defining notification IDs and controlling their display position.
    *   Testing with multiple account IDs.
    *   Automating notifications.
    *   Replacing a single `prevNotificationTime` with a list/deque for tracking.
    *   Refining deque reset logic.
    *   Exploring Gson injection in `NotificationBurstConverter`.
    *   Enhancing special notification display (title with account name, group attachment, icon).
    *   Adding click events to special notifications.
    *   Adding setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`.
    *   Renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.
*   **App Review and Rating Prompt Logic:** Details the proposed behavior for displaying an app review prompt:
    *   Resetting the counter and pausing increment for 90 days after the prompt is shown.
    *   Resuming increment after the 90-day period.
    *   Continuing increment if the prompt has not yet been shown.
*   **App Review To-Dos:** Specific tasks include testing the existing app review code and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
*   **Questions and Answers:** A section dedicated to discussing implementation details for the app review prompt, categorizing questions as "Unanswered" (e.g., module placement, fixing duplicate API calls) and "Answered" (e.g., asset addition for tickets, agent ticket creation, data loss on uninstall, separate PR for refactoring, user on-call detection, use of shared preferences, showing prompt on any screen).
*   **App Review TODOs (Specific scenarios):** Showing the prompt immediately upon achieving the logic condition, not incrementing for browser cases in solution articles, and showing the prompt for "seen" events (though the last point is incomplete).
*   **Miscellaneous Tasks:** Mentions "MDM Browser Config - handle rotation" and "Replace png with svg" (commit not pushed yet).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The document consistently uses bullet points and pseudo-code/examples to outline technical logic and discussion points. It clearly functions as a grooming or planning document for mobile application development, covering aspects of notification management (bursts) and user engagement (app review prompts). The content indicates an Android development context through mentions of `R.string`, `ListNotificationViewModel`, and `Room DB`. The format highlights ongoing tasks, architectural decisions, and open questions, indicating active development and collaboration.

## 1:57:57 PM
The log indicates multiple save events for a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`. The content of this file remained identical across all recorded timestamps, ranging from 2/10/2026, 2:44:43 PM to 2/12/2026, 1:54:53 PM. This suggests that the entries represent periodic saves of the same document rather than discrete content modifications.

The file itself is a detailed markdown document serving as a post-grooming session record, outlining discussions, proposed logic, and to-do items for several Freshservice features.

Key information from the file:

*   **Notification Burst Logic:** A primary section details a proposed logic for handling notification bursts using a deque (double-ended queue).
    *   It defines thresholds `T` (time) and `C` (count) to identify a burst.
    *   A `bool isSpecialNotificationShown` flag is used to control the display of a special notification once per burst, and subsequent notifications within the burst are either discarded or result in no action.
    *   Specific examples (`T=15`, `C=3`) and timestamp sequences (`T0`, `T5`, `T13`, etc.) are provided to illustrate the deque's state and decision-making process for determining if a notification is part of a burst.
    *   An explicit statement is included, affirming that the logic adheres to an acceptance criterion: "Special Notification should be shown when we receive C notifications within T time."
*   **Notification Burst To-Dos/Suggestions:** A comprehensive list of follow-up items for the notification burst feature, including:
    *   Requirements for showing special notifications more than once, managing their ID and position.
    *   Testing considerations for double account IDs and automating notifications.
    *   Implementation details such as replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list, refining deque reset logic, and injecting `gson`.
    *   UI/UX aspects like displaying titles with account names, showing icons, and adding click events for special notifications.
    *   Backend/ViewModel updates: adding setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId`, and considering renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.
*   **Branch-related Tasks:** Mentions an unpushed commit to replace PNGs with SVGs and a task to replace/update an existing special notification.
*   **MDM Browser Config:** A brief note to "handle rotation."
*   **App Review and Rating Prompt:** Outlines the logic for displaying an app review prompt based on time intervals.
    *   The counter for displaying the prompt should reset and stop incrementing for 90 days after the prompt is shown.
    *   It should resume incrementing after the 90-day period.
    *   The counter should always increment if the prompt has not yet been shown.
*   **App Review To-Dos:** Specific action items for the app review feature:
    *   Testing the current app review code functionality.
    *   Refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
*   **Project Questions:** A section categorizing questions as "Unanswered" and "Answered."
    *   **Unanswered:** Whether a separate module is needed for a specific feature, and why the `update tasks api` is called twice.
    *   **Answered:** Clarifications on adding assets to tickets (valid for changes/closing), agent ticket creation (fine), detecting "different" (don't), data loss on uninstall (no problem), creating separate PRs for refactoring (yes), identifying on-call users (no need, increment on `ShiftEventActivity` open), maintaining persona independence, and using shared preferences for counts (no account-wise/unique counts needed). Also, the decision to move app review prompt logic from `HomeActivity` to `AppReviewManager` to allow display on any screen.
*   **General To-Dos:** Additional tasks including immediately showing a prompt when its logic is met, not incrementing the counter for solution articles in the browser case, and showing prompts for "seen" events.

The consistent content across all timestamps indicates a stable set of notes and discussion points within this specific markdown file during the period of these logs. The document serves as a comprehensive record of planning and outstanding tasks for notification handling and app review features within Freshservice.

## 2:57:57 PM
The log details multiple snapshots of the same file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`, across various timestamps between February 10, 2026, and February 17, 2026. Despite the numerous entries, the content of the file remains consistently identical throughout this period, suggesting repeated saves or identical content states being logged.

The file serves as a detailed grooming document, outlining two primary feature discussions:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:**
    *   This section details a system for detecting "notification bursts" using a `deque` (double-ended queue) to store notification timestamps.
    *   It defines two critical parameters: `T` (time threshold, e.g., 15 units) and `C` (count threshold, e.g., 3 notifications).
    *   The core logic dictates that a "special notification" should be shown if `C` notifications are received within `T` time, with subsequent burst notifications being discarded if the special notification is already shown.
    *   Examples with specific timestamps (e.g., `T0=100`, `T5=105`) are provided to illustrate how the deque is managed and how burst conditions are evaluated.
    *   A substantial "Todo / suggestions" list covers implementation details for special notifications, including handling multiple displays, ID and position control, automation, testing for double account IDs, replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list, deque resetting logic, `gson` injection, display of title and icon, click events, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.
    *   Mention is made of an unpushed commit to "Replace png with svg" and "Replace/Update existing special notification."

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:**
    *   This section describes the logic for displaying an in-app review prompt.
    *   A counter-based mechanism is outlined: the counter resets and pauses incrementing for 90 days after the prompt is shown, then resumes incrementing. If the prompt hasn't been shown, the counter increments continuously.
    *   "App Review TODOs" include testing the existing app review code and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   A "Questions" section categorizes points into "Unanswered" (e.g., module placement, duplicate API calls) and "Answered" (e.g., asset addition validity for changes/closing tickets, agent ticket creation, data loss on uninstall, separate PR for refactoring, on-call user detection, use of shared preferences).
    *   Additional "todo" items specify showing the prompt immediately on logic achievement, not incrementing for solution articles viewed in a browser, and showing for "seen" events.

Overall, the file meticulously details the functional requirements, proposed logic, and outstanding tasks for these two distinct features, providing a comprehensive record of a grooming session or planning phase. The unchanging content across timestamps implies a consistent state of the document over the logged period.

## 3:57:56 PM
The provided log exclusively tracks changes to a single markdown file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`.

**File-Specific Updates and Content Overview:**
The content of the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md` file remains identical across all logged entries. It serves as a detailed grooming document or personal notes for a Freshservice project, focusing on two primary features:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:**
    *   This section describes a system for detecting "burst" notifications using a deque data structure.
    *   It defines parameters `T` (time threshold) and `C` (count threshold) to identify when `C` notifications are received within `T` time.
    *   The logic outlines how to push notifications to the front of the deque and pop from the back, compare new notifications with the oldest in the deque, and manage a `isSpecialNotificationShown` flag.
    *   When a burst is detected, a special notification is shown, or subsequent burst notifications are discarded. If the time threshold is exceeded, normal notifications are shown, and the deque is reset.
    *   Includes concrete examples (`T=15, C=3`) with epoch timestamps to illustrate burst detection.
    *   **Todo / Suggestions:** A comprehensive list of action items and questions related to special notifications, such as:
        *   Showing special notifications more than once.
        *   Determining notification IDs and controlling their position (default bottom, `setSortKey` for top).
        *   Testing for double account IDs and automating notifications.
        *   Replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list/deque.
        *   Refining deque reset logic.
        *   Injecting Gson into `NotificationBurstConverter`.
        *   Displaying titles with account names and showing icons for special notifications.
        *   Adding click events for special notifications.
        *   Adding setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`.
        *   Renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:**
    *   This section details the logic for displaying an app review prompt.
    *   It specifies that the counter for the prompt should reset when shown and not increment for the next 90 days. After 90 days, incrementing resumes. If not yet shown, incrementing continues.
    *   **App Review TODOs:**
        *   Testing the current app review code functionality.
        *   Refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   **Questions:**
        *   **Unanswered:** Whether a separate module is needed for app review or if it's fine in the core module, and if a double API call for update tasks should be fixed.
        *   **Answered:** Clarifications on asset additions for tickets (valid for changes/closing - yes), agent ticket creation (fine), detecting "different" (don't), data loss on uninstall (no problem), creating a separate PR for refactoring (yes), and recognizing on-call status (no need, increment on `ShiftEventActivity` open). It also clarifies to keep it persona-independent and use shared preferences (not account-wise), and to move the prompt logic to `AppReviewManager` to show it on any screen.
    *   **Specific TODOs:**
        *   Immediately show the prompt on the page where the logic was achieved.
        *   Do not increment for solution articles in the browser case.
        *   Show the prompt for "seen" events.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The log indicates multiple save or commit events across several days in February 2026:
*   **February 10, 2026:** Multiple rapid changes/saves occurred between 2:44:43 PM and 2:45:28 PM.
*   **February 12, 2026:** Further rapid changes/saves occurred from 12:11:43 PM to 1:54:53 PM.
*   **February 17, 2026:** Another set of rapid changes/saves occurred between 2:21:47 PM and 2:23:26 PM.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in Content:**
The most striking pattern is the **complete invariance of the file's content** across all 16 logged entries. Despite being logged at different timestamps, the content of the `Post Grooming.md` file did not change. This suggests that the log might be capturing save operations even when no textual modifications were made, or that the content was finalized early and the subsequent entries are tracking unrelated operations or repeated saves of the same content. The document itself shows a consistent structure of problem descriptions, proposed solutions/logic (like the deque for notifications), and detailed todo/suggestion lists with accompanying questions and answers.
