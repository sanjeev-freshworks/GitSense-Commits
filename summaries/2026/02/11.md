# Activity Summary for 2/11/2026

## 12:39:50 AM
The provided log details changes to a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`, across five timestamps between 2/10/2026, 2:44:43 PM and 2/10/2026, 2:45:28 PM. The content of the file is identical across all logged entries, indicating that no substantive code changes occurred during this period; rather, the file was likely saved or accessed multiple times.

The document itself is a "Post Grooming" markdown file outlining two main development topics:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:** This section details an algorithm for detecting a "notification burst" based on receiving `C` notifications within `T` time.
    *   It uses a deque (`back[]front`) to store notification timestamps, pushing new notifications to the front and potentially popping from the back.
    *   A `bool isSpecialNotificationShown` flag is used to manage the display of a "special notification," showing it once during a burst and then potentially discarding subsequent burst notifications.
    *   Examples are provided (`T=15, C=3`) with specific epoch times to illustrate how burst conditions are evaluated.
    *   A comprehensive list of "Todo / suggestions" for special notifications includes showing them more than once, determining notification IDs and positions, testing for double account IDs, automation, replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list, resetting deque logic, injecting Gson, displaying titles with account names/groups, showing icons, adding click events, and adding setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`. It also suggests renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:** This section outlines the logic for displaying an app review prompt.
    *   The prompt counter should reset upon display and not increment for 90 days. After 90 days, it resumes incrementing.
    *   "App Review TODO" items include testing existing code and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   A "Questions" section categorizes items as "Unanswered" (e.g., module separation, duplicate API calls) and "Answered" (e.g., adding assets to tickets, agent ticket creation, data loss on uninstall, separate PR for refactoring, recognizing on-call status, using shared preferences).
    *   Further "todo" items mention immediately showing the prompt on the page where the logic is achieved, not incrementing for browser-based solution articles, and showing for "seen" events.

**Recurring elements and patterns:**
The document consistently structures its content with a high-level topic, followed by detailed logic or requirements, and then a list of "Todo / suggestions" and "Questions" (some answered, some unanswered). This format suggests an active discussion, design, or grooming phase for these features, where implementation details and potential issues are being documented and clarified. The repeated logging of the identical content within a short timeframe likely indicates minor interactions with the file (e.g., opening, viewing, saving without modification) rather than actual code evolution within this specific log.

## 5:30:18 AM
The log details multiple entries for a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`. All entries share identical content, indicating that these timestamps (ranging from 2/10/2026, 2:44:43 PM to 2/10/2026, 2:45:28 PM) represent sequential saves or loggings of the same document state rather than distinct code changes.

The document outlines discussions and design considerations for two main features:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic**:
    *   This section details a mechanism to detect and handle "bursts" of notifications using a `deque` (double-ended queue).
    *   Key parameters are `T` (time threshold) and `C` (count threshold). A burst occurs if `C` notifications are received within `T` time.
    *   The logic defines how to push new notifications to the front of the deque and pop old ones from the back.
    *   A `bool isSpecialNotificationShown` flag is used to control the display of a special notification when a burst is detected, often discarding subsequent notifications within the same burst to avoid spam.
    *   Examples are provided (`T=15, C=3`) with specific epoch timestamps to illustrate burst detection scenarios and non-burst conditions.
    *   **Recurring elements/patterns**: The document uses a consistent structure for describing notification reception and subsequent deque manipulation and special notification handling. The examples demonstrate the edge cases and behavior of the `deque` with varying timestamps.
    *   **Todo/Suggestions**: A comprehensive list of development tasks and questions related to special notifications is included, such as showing them multiple times, controlling their position and ID, testing with double account IDs, automation, replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list, resetting deque logic, injecting Gson, displaying titles/icons, adding click events, and modifying `ListNotificationViewModel` for relevant flags and IDs. It also suggests renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt**:
    *   This section describes the logic for displaying an in-app review prompt.
    *   A counter should reset when the prompt is shown and not increment for the next 90 days. After 90 days, incrementation resumes. If the prompt hasn't been shown, the counter continues to increment.
    *   **App Review TODOs**: Includes tasks like testing existing code and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   **Questions**: A list of questions, both "Unanswered" (e.g., separate module, duplicate API calls) and "Answered" (e.g., asset addition validity, agent ticket creation, data loss on uninstall, separate PR for refactoring, on-call detection, shared preferences for counts, moving prompt logic to `AppReviewManager`), is provided.
    *   **Specific todos**: Immediately showing the prompt where logic is achieved, not incrementing for browser-based solution articles, and for "seen" events.

Other minor notes in the document include "MDM Browser Config - handle rotation" and a development status about replacing PNGs with SVGs.
