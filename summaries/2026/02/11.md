# Activity Summary for 2/11/2026

## 12:39:50 AM
The provided log details changes to a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`, across five timestamps between 2/10/2026, 2:44:43 PM and 2/10/2026, 2:45:28 PM. The content of the file is identical across all logged entries, indicating that no substantive code changes occurred during this period; rather, the file was likely saved or accessed multiple times.

The document itself is a "Post Grooming" markdown file outlining two main development topics:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:** This section details an algorithm for detecting a "notification burst" based on receiving `C` notifications within `T` time.
    *   It uses a deque (`back[]front`) to store notification timestamps, pushing new notifications to the front and potentially popping from the back.
    *   A `bool isSpecialNotificationShown` flag is used to manage the display of a "special notification," showing it once during a burst and then potentially discarding subsequent burst notifications.
    *   Examples are provided (`T=15, C=3`) with specific epoch times to illustrate how burst conditions are evaluated.
    *   A comprehensive list of "Todo / suggestions" for special notifications includes showing them more than once, determining notification IDs and positions, testing for double account IDs, automation, replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list, resetting deque logic, injecting Gson, displaying titles with account names/groups, showing icons, adding click events, and adding setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`. It also suggests renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:** This section outlines the logic for displaying an app review prompt.
    *   The prompt counter should reset upon display and not increment for 90 days. After 90 days, it resumes incrementing.
    *   "App Review TODO" items include testing existing code and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   A "Questions" section categorizes items as "Unanswered" (e.g., module separation, duplicate API calls) and "Answered" (e.g., adding assets to tickets, agent ticket creation, data loss on uninstall, separate PR for refactoring, recognizing on-call status, using shared preferences).
    *   Further "todo" items mention immediately showing the prompt on the page where the logic is achieved, not incrementing for browser-based solution articles, and showing for "seen" events.

**Recurring elements and patterns:**
The document consistently structures its content with a high-level topic, followed by detailed logic or requirements, and then a list of "Todo / suggestions" and "Questions" (some answered, some unanswered). This format suggests an active discussion, design, or grooming phase for these features, where implementation details and potential issues are being documented and clarified. The repeated logging of the identical content within a short timeframe likely indicates minor interactions with the file (e.g., opening, viewing, saving without modification) rather than actual code evolution within this specific log.

## 5:30:18 AM
The log details multiple entries for a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`. All entries share identical content, indicating that these timestamps (ranging from 2/10/2026, 2:44:43 PM to 2/10/2026, 2:45:28 PM) represent sequential saves or loggings of the same document state rather than distinct code changes.

The document outlines discussions and design considerations for two main features:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic**:
    *   This section details a mechanism to detect and handle "bursts" of notifications using a `deque` (double-ended queue).
    *   Key parameters are `T` (time threshold) and `C` (count threshold). A burst occurs if `C` notifications are received within `T` time.
    *   The logic defines how to push new notifications to the front of the deque and pop old ones from the back.
    *   A `bool isSpecialNotificationShown` flag is used to control the display of a special notification when a burst is detected, often discarding subsequent notifications within the same burst to avoid spam.
    *   Examples are provided (`T=15, C=3`) with specific epoch timestamps to illustrate burst detection scenarios and non-burst conditions.
    *   **Recurring elements/patterns**: The document uses a consistent structure for describing notification reception and subsequent deque manipulation and special notification handling. The examples demonstrate the edge cases and behavior of the `deque` with varying timestamps.
    *   **Todo/Suggestions**: A comprehensive list of development tasks and questions related to special notifications is included, such as showing them multiple times, controlling their position and ID, testing with double account IDs, automation, replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list, resetting deque logic, injecting Gson, displaying titles/icons, adding click events, and modifying `ListNotificationViewModel` for relevant flags and IDs. It also suggests renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt**:
    *   This section describes the logic for displaying an in-app review prompt.
    *   A counter should reset when the prompt is shown and not increment for the next 90 days. After 90 days, incrementation resumes. If the prompt hasn't been shown, the counter continues to increment.
    *   **App Review TODOs**: Includes tasks like testing existing code and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   **Questions**: A list of questions, both "Unanswered" (e.g., separate module, duplicate API calls) and "Answered" (e.g., asset addition validity, agent ticket creation, data loss on uninstall, separate PR for refactoring, on-call detection, shared preferences for counts, moving prompt logic to `AppReviewManager`), is provided.
    *   **Specific todos**: Immediately showing the prompt where logic is achieved, not incrementing for browser-based solution articles, and for "seen" events.

Other minor notes in the document include "MDM Browser Config - handle rotation" and a development status about replacing PNGs with SVGs.

## 2:00:14 PM
The log captures changes to a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`. All entries, recorded between 2:44:43 PM and 2:45:28 PM on February 10, 2026, show identical content, suggesting a series of snapshots of the same file without intermediate edits, or perhaps an automated save process.

The document outlines several key areas:

**1. Notification Burst Logic:**
This section details a system for managing notification bursts using a deque (double-ended queue) with parameters `T` (time threshold, e.g., 15 seconds) and `C` (count threshold, e.g., 3 notifications).
*   **Mechanism**: New notifications (`T0`, `T1`, etc.) are added to the front. The system checks if `C` notifications have been received within `T` time.
*   **Special Notification**: A `isSpecialNotificationShown` boolean flag controls whether a special notification is displayed or if subsequent notifications in a burst are discarded.
*   **Examples**: Several scenarios are provided to illustrate how notifications are processed, including examples of when a burst is detected (`T14` being a burst with `T0` or `T13`) and when it's not (e.g., `T28/T21` not being a burst with `T5`). It clarifies that a special notification should be shown when `C` notifications are received within `T` time.
*   **Todo/Suggestions**: A detailed list of improvements and questions regarding the notification burst feature, including showing special notifications multiple times, managing their ID and position, handling account IDs, automating tests, replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list, resetting the deque, injecting `gson`, displaying titles and icons, adding click events, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem`.

**2. App Review and Rating Prompt:**
*   **Logic**: Rules are defined for when an app review prompt should be displayed. A counter is reset for 90 days after the prompt is shown, and then increments again. If the prompt hasn't been shown, the counter keeps incrementing.
*   **App Review TODO**: Tasks include testing the existing app review code and refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.

**3. Miscellaneous Development Points:**
*   **MDM Browser Config**: A note to handle rotation.
*   **Branch specific tasks**: Mention of replacing PNG with SVG (commit not yet pushed) and updating existing special notifications.
*   **Questions (Answered & Unanswered)**: A discussion covering various development and design considerations:
    *   Whether to use a separate module for app review logic (unanswered).
    *   Fixing duplicate API calls for update tasks (unanswered).
    *   Confirmation that adding assets to tickets applies to changes and closing tickets (answered: yes).
    *   Agent ticket creation (answered: fine).
    *   Detecting "different" (answered: don't).
    *   Data loss on uninstall (answered: not an issue).
    *   Creating a separate PR for refactoring (answered: yes, based on Vasanth's review).
    *   Recognizing if a user is on-call (answered: not needed, just increment when `ShiftEventActivity` is opened).
    *   Keeping logic persona-independent (answered: yes).
    *   Using shared preferences without account-wise or unique counts (answered: yes).
    *   Displaying the app review prompt on any screen when conditions are met (answered: move logic from `HomeActivity` to `AppReviewManager`).
*   **App Review Todos (Specific)**: Immediately showing the prompt on the logic-achieved page, not incrementing for solution articles in browser cases, and showing the prompt for "seen" events.

The file essentially serves as a detailed "post-grooming" memo or a development plan, outlining features, logic, open questions, and tasks for upcoming work within Freshservice, specifically focusing on notification management and app review prompts.

## 3:00:13 PM
The provided logs all refer to a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`, with identical content across all entries. The timestamps indicate these entries were recorded in quick succession on 2/10/2026, between 2:44:43 PM and 2:45:28 PM, suggesting rapid saves or a logging of the same document multiple times.

The document itself is a "Post Grooming" note, detailing logic, considerations, and To-Do items for two main features:

1.  **Notification Burst Mechanism**:
    *   **Logic**: Describes an algorithm using a deque (`T` for time threshold, `C` for count threshold) to identify a "burst" of notifications. It outlines how incoming notifications (`T0, T1, T2...`) are processed, pushed to the front of the deque, and compared with the oldest entry to determine if `C` notifications have arrived within `T` time.
    *   **Special Notification Handling**: Explains when a `isSpecialNotificationShown` flag is used to display a special notification or discard subsequent ones during a burst. It details scenarios for when to clear the deque or reset the flag if the time threshold is exceeded.
    *   **Examples**: Provides numerical examples (`T=15, C=3`) to illustrate the burst detection logic.
    *   **To-Dos/Suggestions**: Includes numerous points for refinement such as showing special notifications multiple times, managing their ID and position, testing with double account IDs, automating notifications, replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list, resetting the deque, injecting `gson`, customizing special notification titles/icons, adding click events, checking count usage, adding setters/getters in `ListNotificationViewModel`, and renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt**:
    *   **Logic**: Specifies rules for showing the app review prompt, including resetting a counter after the prompt is shown, a 90-day cooldown period before incrementing again, and continuous incrementation if the prompt hasn't been shown.
    *   **App Review To-Dos**: Mentions testing the current implementation, refactoring `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   **Questions & Answers**: A list of questions regarding implementation details, some answered, some unanswered:
        *   **Unanswered**: Whether a separate module is needed and if a double API call for update tasks should be fixed.
        *   **Answered**: Confirms adding assets applies to changes/closing tickets, agents can create tickets, no specific detection for "different" events, data loss on uninstall is acceptable, refactoring should be a separate PR, user on-call status is not needed (increment on `ShiftEventActivity` open), persona independence and shared preferences should be used (no account-wise counts), and the prompt logic should be moved to `AppReviewManager` to be triggerable from any screen.
    *   **Additional To-Dos**: Immediately show the prompt where the logic is achieved, do not increment for browser cases in solution articles, and show the prompt for "seen" events when the user... (incomplete sentence).

**Recurring Elements/Patterns**:
The log repeatedly captures the same "Post Grooming" document, which serves as a structured summary of product/feature requirements and technical considerations. This document consistently outlines problem statements (e.g., notification bursts, app review timing), proposed solutions/logic, examples, and detailed action items or questions for developers. The format with bulleted To-Dos and structured Q&A is a recurring pattern within the document. Other minor mentions include "MDM Browser Config - handle rotation" and "Replace png with svg".

## 11:00:16 PM
The log captures multiple snapshots of a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/Personal Use/Post Grooming.md`. The content of this file remained identical across all recorded timestamps: 2/10/2026, 2:44:43 PM; 2/10/2026, 2:44:55 PM; 2/10/2026, 2:45:06 PM; 2/10/2026, 2:45:15 PM; and 2/10/2026, 2:45:28 PM. This indicates a series of saves or records of the file's state without any content modification between these specific log entries.

The file itself is a "Post Grooming" markdown document, outlining discussions, design considerations, and To-Do items for several features within a Freshservice application, likely related to an Android mobile app.

Key information and topics covered:

1.  **Notification Burst Logic:**
    *   Details a mechanism to detect a "notification burst," defined as receiving `C` notifications within `T` time.
    *   Uses a deque (double-ended queue) to manage notification timestamps (`T0`, `T1`, `T2`, etc.), pushing new notifications to the front and popping from the back.
    *   A `bool isSpecialNotificationShown` flag controls the display of a special notification when a burst is detected, and subsequent burst notifications are discarded.
    *   If the time threshold (`T`) is exceeded, the deque is reset, and a normal notification is shown.
    *   Includes specific values (e.g., `T = 15`, `C = 3`) and provides examples and test scenarios for various notification arrival patterns to validate the burst detection and special notification display logic.
    *   **To-Do / Suggestions for Notifications:** A comprehensive list of action items, including:
        *   Allowing special notifications to be shown more than once.
        *   Defining notification IDs and controlling their position.
        *   Testing for double account IDs and automating notifications.
        *   Replacing `prevNotificationTime` with a list and refining deque reset logic.
        *   Checking for Gson injection in `NotificationBurstConverter`.
        *   Customizing special notification title with account name, attaching to groups, and showing icons.
        *   Adding click events for special notifications.
        *   Adding setters/getters for `shouldShowSpecialNotification` and `accountId` in `ListNotificationViewModel`.
        *   Considering renaming `NotificationBurstItem` to `SafeNotificationItem`.

2.  **App Review and Rating Prompt:**
    *   Outlines the logic for displaying an app review prompt and managing its counter.
    *   The counter should reset for 90 days after the prompt is shown, then resume incrementing.
    *   If the prompt hasn't been shown, the counter should keep incrementing.
    *   **App Review To-Do:**
        *   Test the existing app review code functionality.
        *   Refactor `AppReviewManager` and `AppStore`.
    *   **Questions (Unanswered and Answered):** Discusses design and implementation choices:
        *   Module placement (core module is fine).
        *   Addressing duplicate API calls (`update tasks api`).
        *   Asset handling for tickets (valid for changes/closing).
        *   Agent ticket creation (fine).
        *   Handling "different" criteria (don't detect).
        *   Data loss on uninstall (not a concern).
        *   Creating a separate PR for refactoring (yes).
        *   Detecting "on-call" users (no need, increment on `ShiftEventActivity` open).
        *   Keeping it persona independent and using shared preferences (no account-wise/unique counts).
        *   Showing the prompt on any screen where conditions are met by moving logic to `AppReviewManager`.
    *   **Additional App Review To-Do:**
        *   Show prompt immediately on the page where the logic condition is met.
        *   Avoid incrementing for browser-based solution articles.
        *   Show the prompt for "seen" events.

3.  **Miscellaneous Notes:**
    *   A brief mention of "MDM Browser Config - handle rotation."
    *   Notes on a pending branch commit: "Replace png with svg" and "Replace/Update existing special notification."
