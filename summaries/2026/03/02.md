# Activity Summary for 3/2/2026

## 12:19:00 AM
For the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/form/fields/requester/model/form_requester_field_ui_data.dart`, the `FormRequesterFieldUIData` class, which implements `FormCustomFieldData`, remained functionally consistent throughout the observed changes. This class is responsible for handling requester field data within forms, including converting user information (`FSUserUIModel`) into domain models for requester email and ID, and providing values for business rule condition validation. The only changes recorded were cosmetic:
*   On 2/27/2026, 12:31:32 PM, a commented-out URL was added, likely for reference or testing purposes related to business rules API.
*   By 2/27/2026, 6:06:06 PM, this and any other previously present commented-out URLs were removed, suggesting a cleanup of temporary notes or removal of irrelevant documentation.

For the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/form/businessrule/condition/validator/user/br_current_user_condition_validator.dart`, which defines a validator for business rule conditions based on current user details, several key changes occurred:
*   On 2/27/2026, 6:31:30 PM, an import for `package:user_lib/user_lib.dart` was added. This likely prepared the ground for introducing a new user-related type.
*   Shortly after, on 2/27/2026, 6:36:01 PM, the `user` parameter's type within the `BRCurrentUserConditionValidatorInput` class was updated from `BRUserInfo` to `UserDetail`. This indicates a refactoring to use a more specific or updated user data model for validation.
*   Finally, on 2/27/2026, 7:59:19 PM, the `package:user_lib/user_lib.dart` import was removed. This suggests that the `UserDetail` type is now resolved from an already existing or local import (e.g., `support_portal/src/data/model/user/me/user_detail.dart`), thus consolidating dependencies and making the `user_lib` import redundant.

All changes across both files occurred on 2/27/2026, indicating a focused period of development, likely involving minor refactoring, cleanup, and type adjustments related to user data and business rule validation within the `support_portal` feature of the `Freshservice` Flutter application.
