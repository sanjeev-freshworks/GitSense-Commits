# Activity Summary for 3/1/2026

## 3:12:01 AM
The provided log details changes across two Dart files within the `mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal` feature on February 27, 2026.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/form/fields/requester/model/form_requester_field_ui_data.dart`**
This file defines `FormRequesterFieldUIData`, a class implementing `FormCustomFieldData` for handling requester-related form fields. It includes properties for `FSUserUIModel` (value) and `workspaceId`, and methods for `getDomainModels` (to return requester email and ID), `getFieldValueForConditionValidation`, and `getFieldValueForBRValidation`.

*   **2/27/2026, 12:30:59 PM:** The file was initially committed with a commented-out URL reference related to business rules (`freshworkshelpdesk276.freshservice.com`).
*   **2/27/2026, 12:31:32 PM:** A second, more detailed commented-out URL related to business rule APIs was added below the existing comment, providing further context for business rule evaluation.
*   **2/27/2026, 6:06:06 PM:** Both previously added commented-out URLs were removed. The functional code of the `FormRequesterFieldUIData` class remained consistent throughout these changes.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/form/businessrule/condition/validator/user/br_current_user_condition_validator.dart`**
This file defines the `BRCurrentUserConditionValidatorInput` class and an abstract `BRCurrentUserConditionValidator` for validating business rule conditions against current user details.

*   **2/27/2026, 6:31:08 PM:** The file was initially committed, defining `BRCurrentUserConditionValidatorInput` with a `BRUserInfo` type for its `user` field, and the abstract `validate` method.
*   **2/27/2026, 6:31:30 PM:** An import statement for `package:user_lib/user_lib.dart` was added.
*   **2/27/2026, 6:35:31 PM** and **6:35:37 PM:** Two subsequent entries show no discernible code changes, suggesting minor saves or whitespace adjustments not captured in the log.
*   **2/27/2026, 6:36:01 PM:** A significant change occurred where the type of the `user` field in `BRCurrentUserConditionValidatorInput` was updated from `BRUserInfo` to `UserDetail`, indicating a refactoring to use a more specific user data model.
*   **2/27/2026, 7:59:19 PM:** The `import 'package:user_lib/user_lib.dart';` statement, which was added earlier, was removed. This implies that `UserDetail` is now accessible without this external import, likely resolved from within the `support_portal` feature itself.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
All documented changes occurred on the same day, February 27, 2026. The modifications primarily involve small, focused updates such as adding/removing comments, adjusting import statements, and refining data types (e.g., `BRUserInfo` to `UserDetail`). Several timestamps show identical code, indicating frequent saves or minor, non-functional changes during development. The overall context points to ongoing development within the `support_portal` feature, specifically around form handling and the evaluation of business rules based on user information.
