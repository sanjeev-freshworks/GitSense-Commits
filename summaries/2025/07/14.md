# Activity Summary for 7/14/2025

## 12:07:11 PM
The log shows updates to the localization files for a Flutter application, specifically focusing on English ("en") translations.  The main changes revolve around the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/l10n` directory.

Between 11:48:35 AM and 11:48:53 AM, the `localizations.dart` file underwent a minor revision.  This revision seems to have been a merge conflict resolution, indicated by the presence of `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` markers within the file, with minimal code changes.  The core functionality of the file, which defines the localization delegate and its methods, remains unchanged.

At 11:49:21 AM, `localizations_en.dart` was updated. This file contains the English translations of strings.  The addition of `"solutions": "Solutions";` is a key change, adding a new translation.

The `intl_en.arb` file, containing the source strings for English translations, saw several updates between 11:49:50 AM and 11:50:39 AM. There was a merge conflict resolved (similar to `localizations.dart`) initially adding "solutions" and a later commit removing the duplicate entry for "searchArticles".  These changes consistently add and then refine the translations, particularly adding the "solutions" string and resolving a duplicate entry for "searchArticles". The final version includes translations for "categories", "searchArticles",  "folderCountLabel", "articlesCountLabel", "popularArticlesTitle", "emptyFolderLabel", and "solutions".  The changes show a clear progression of adding and then cleaning up the translations.  The pluralization logic for folder and article counts is established consistently.
