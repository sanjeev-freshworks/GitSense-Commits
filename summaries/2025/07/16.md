# Activity Summary for 7/16/2025

## 3:56:53 PM
The code changes document the technical design of a Freshservice mobile application's "Solution Revamp" feature.  The design includes separate documentation for the technical design document (`.md` file) and diagrams (`.md` file).  Multiple revisions of the technical design document exist, with the last update time listed as April 8th, 2025, although the log shows subsequent modifications on July 16th, 2025.

The technical design document details various aspects of the revamp, including architectural diagrams (linked to Lucidchart), component descriptions (UI, data, domain layers), API interfaces (listing numerous GET, PUT, and POST requests to `/support/v2/solutions` and `/api/_/solutions` endpoints, differentiating between requester and agent APIs), security and compliance considerations (notably lacking authentication and authorization details), and planned observability using Heap and Firebase.  A key constraint noted is a horizontal webview scroll issue on the article detail page.  The document extensively lists the planned APIs and their URLs, categorizing them by requester and agent functionalities. Several sections are marked as "TBD" indicating areas requiring further work.

The technical design diagram file provides more detailed information about the user interface (UI) wireframes for different pages (homepage, category/folder views, article details, search results, and agent-specific article creation/editing).  It also outlines data flow diagrams, mobile-specific considerations (responsiveness and platform-specific features), the technical stack (Flutter, BLoC, GoRouter), screen navigation flows, API integration points, performance considerations (caching strategies and loading optimization), error handling (network and content errors), accessibility features, and testing strategies.

A later entry in the log shows a more structured breakdown of the design, illustrating the architecture using BLoC and use cases.  This includes specific BLoC classes (ArticleDetailPageBloc, SolutionFolderDetailPageBloc, etc.), their dependencies, events, and states.  It uses Mermaid to create diagrams detailing class models and data flows for both agent and requester flows, including a breakdown of UI widgets and package structure. Finally, one entry contains an empty file.  The overall design emphasizes a modular and well-structured approach, leveraging Flutter and a clean architecture.

The log shows multiple revisions of a technical design document (`tech_design_diagram.md`) detailing the architecture of a mobile application, likely using Flutter.  The document focuses on three main areas: Requester Solution Home, Requester Popular Articles, and Agent Article Detail.  Significant changes occurred between 4:19:55 PM and 4:22:35 PM with the addition of the "Requester Popular Articles" section.  Another notable change happened between 4:32:37 PM and 4:33:40 PM where the "Agent Article Detail" section was added.  Subsequent updates, between 4:44:04 PM and 4:44:41 PM, involved minor refinements to the "Agent Article Detail" section's Bloc Diagram, specifically removing the `UpdateArticleDetail`, `UploadAttachment`, and `DeleteAttachment` events from the `ArticleDetailBloc`.


Each section consistently follows a structure:
* **Mobile UI Mockup:** Describes the user interface.
* **Domain Diagram (using Mermaid syntax):** Illustrates the application's domain model using class diagrams.  This shows the key classes, their attributes, and relationships.  `ArticleModel` and `CategoryModel` are consistently used across sections.
* **Bloc Diagram (using Mermaid syntax):** Depicts the application's business logic using class diagrams, showing the `Bloc` pattern with events and states.  The `Bloc` diagrams follow a similar structure for each feature, utilizing `Load` and `Refresh` events, and `Initial`, `Loading`, `Loaded`, and `Error` states.


The domain models show a consistent use of data classes such as `ArticleModel`, `CategoryModel`, and `SolutionHomeModel`, which suggests a well-structured data layer.  The repeated use of `SolutionRepository`, `SolutionRepositoryImpl`, `RemoteDataSource` and `LocalDataSource` indicates a design incorporating both remote and local data sources. The evolution of the `ArticleDetailBloc` suggests an iterative design process focusing on initial functionality before adding update and attachment capabilities later removed.
