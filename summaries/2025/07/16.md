The code changes document the technical design of a Freshservice mobile application's "Solution Revamp" feature.  The design includes separate documentation for the technical design document (`.md` file) and diagrams (`.md` file).  Multiple revisions of the technical design document exist, with the last update time listed as April 8th, 2025, although the log shows subsequent modifications on July 16th, 2025.

The technical design document details various aspects of the revamp, including architectural diagrams (linked to Lucidchart), component descriptions (UI, data, domain layers), API interfaces (listing numerous GET, PUT, and POST requests to `/support/v2/solutions` and `/api/_/solutions` endpoints, differentiating between requester and agent APIs), security and compliance considerations (notably lacking authentication and authorization details), and planned observability using Heap and Firebase.  A key constraint noted is a horizontal webview scroll issue on the article detail page.  The document extensively lists the planned APIs and their URLs, categorizing them by requester and agent functionalities. Several sections are marked as "TBD" indicating areas requiring further work.

The technical design diagram file provides more detailed information about the user interface (UI) wireframes for different pages (homepage, category/folder views, article details, search results, and agent-specific article creation/editing).  It also outlines data flow diagrams, mobile-specific considerations (responsiveness and platform-specific features), the technical stack (Flutter, BLoC, GoRouter), screen navigation flows, API integration points, performance considerations (caching strategies and loading optimization), error handling (network and content errors), accessibility features, and testing strategies.

A later entry in the log shows a more structured breakdown of the design, illustrating the architecture using BLoC and use cases.  This includes specific BLoC classes (ArticleDetailPageBloc, SolutionFolderDetailPageBloc, etc.), their dependencies, events, and states.  It uses Mermaid to create diagrams detailing class models and data flows for both agent and requester flows, including a breakdown of UI widgets and package structure. Finally, one entry contains an empty file.  The overall design emphasizes a modular and well-structured approach, leveraging Flutter and a clean architecture.
