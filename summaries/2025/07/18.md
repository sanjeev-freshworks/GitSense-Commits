# Activity Summary for 7/18/2025

## 3:10:40 AM
The log shows code changes related to the development of an "Agent Article Detail" feature in a Flutter mobile application.  The changes span several files and primarily focus on the presentation layer (model, bloc, UI mapper).

Between 10:55 PM and 11:00 PM, prompts were generated for code generation of the model, bloc, and UI mapper for the `Agent Article Detail` feature. These prompts utilize  `generic_presentation_layer_models_codegen.prompt`, `generic_presentation_layer_bloc_codegen.prompt`, and `generic_presentation_layer_ui_mapper_codegen.prompt` as templates.  The inputs across all prompts are consistent, referencing a localization file (`intl_en.arb`), PRD, and tech design documents. The `intl_en.arb` file was updated incrementally between 10:56 PM and 10:59 PM, adding keys for article information (created on, modified by, location, author, workspace, views, helpful and not helpful counts), and their corresponding placeholders.

Between 11:01 PM and 11:17 PM, several Dart files were added or updated. `article_detail_navigation_state.dart` defines navigation states for actions like downloading attachments, viewing categories/folders/author profiles, editing articles, closing popups, and sending results. `article_detail_ui_state.dart` defines the UI states (loading, content, error).  `article_detail_ui_event.dart` outlines events for loading, refreshing, downloading attachments, and navigation actions.  `article_detail_ui_model.dart` defines data models for article detail and attachments.   The UI mapper prompt was also repeatedly modified between 11:08 PM and 11:08 PM, clarifying the location of the `ArticleDetailModel`. Finally, `article_detail_ui_model.dart` was modified slightly between 11:11 PM and 11:17 PM, but the changes are minor and appear to be formatting adjustments rather than functional changes.

A test fixture (`article_detail_fixture.dart`) and associated tests (`article_detail_ui_mapper_test.dart`) were added between 11:17 PM and 11:20 PM, to validate the mapping of the data model to the UI model.   These tests cover various scenarios, including null or empty values in the data model. The tests were further refined between 11:18 PM and 11:20 PM, fixing minor issues.

Between 11:25 PM and 11:28 PM, the bloc prompt was re-run, possibly to address minor issues or to incorporate changes made since the initial prompt execution. Lastly, between 11:33 PM and 11:40 PM, the `article_detail_bloc.dart` file underwent significant updates to implement the bloc logic, handling various events, including loading article details, refreshing the screen, downloading attachments, navigation, and action selection. The bloc makes use of analytics tracking for different events.  The implementation in `article_detail_bloc.dart` changed between 11:33 PM and 11:40 PM to include error handling, a switch case for use case results, and to properly handle navigation state changes from different event types. Finally, a test file `article_detail_bloc_test.dart` was added at 11:41 PM, which includes tests for the bloc's behavior when handling different events.  Minor edits were done in the test between 11:41 PM and 11:42 PM, clarifying some expectations and imports.


## 12:07:13 PM
The log shows iterative modifications to a `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/demo.md` file documenting a GitHub Copilot Agent demo for code generation within a Flutter project.  The initial versions (10:50:53 AM to 10:51:39 AM) focus on showcasing Copilot's capabilities in generating code for Data, Domain, and Presentation layers of a simple epic, reducing development time from 16 days to 9 days.  The demo highlights Copilot's different modes (Ask, Edit, Agent) and the challenges faced, such as difficulties with the Presentation Layer and occasional generation of incomplete or incorrect code.  The  `demo.md` file is further refined between 11:17:30 AM and 11:20:26 AM, adding a "Resources" section with a link to Copilot customization documentation and clarifying the types of instruction files (workspace vs. user).  Finally, at 11:20:26 AM, the description of Copilot instructions is improved to better explain custom instructions and their usage.

Two additional files, `usecase_guidelines.instructions.md` (11:43:34 AM) and `usecase_test_guidelines.instructions.md` (11:43:49 AM, further updated at 11:51:26 AM, 11:51:36 AM, and 11:56:20 AM), provide detailed instructions for creating and testing UseCases in the project. `usecase_guidelines.instructions.md` gives a thorough explanation of the expected structure, best practices, dependency injection, and file organization for creating UseCases within the Clean Architecture.  `usecase_test_guidelines.instructions.md` initially detailed a testing approach using Mockoon responses via dependency injection but later versions shifted to explain both Mockoon-based testing and traditional mocking with Mockito, providing various test structures and examples along with best practices.  The final version (12:04:25 PM) of `usecase_test_guidelines.instructions.md` emphasizes Mockoon-based testing for its integration testing benefits. Finally, at 12:04:38 PM and 12:06:30 PM, two prompt files `usecase_codegen.prompt.md` and `sample_usecase_codegen.prompt.md` are added detailing how to gather input, parse, and use the input to generate UseCases in the project.  The second prompt file provides a sample use case for generating code.  The overall pattern across all these files suggests a focus on streamlining development and testing processes using AI-assisted tools.


## 1:23:14 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the development and testing of a `GetSolutionArticleDetailUseCase` within a Flutter project using Freshservice's API.  The changes span several files, with the most significant activity around the use case itself and its associated test file.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/domain/sample_usecase_codegen.prompt.md` file was modified multiple times between 12:07 PM and 12:27 PM. These changes primarily involved refining the prompt used for code generation, specifically adjusting the notes section to clarify the `ArticleDetailModel` naming and the expected `articleId` for tests. The path parameter value in the prompt was also removed during this time.

Between 12:09 PM and 12:41 PM, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/di/solution_domain_module.dart` file was updated. This reflects the registration of the new `GetSolutionArticleDetailUseCase` within the dependency injection (DI) container.

The `GetSolutionArticleDetailUseCase` file (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/usecase/get_solution_article_detail_use_case.dart`) underwent numerous revisions between 12:13 PM and 12:40 PM. These iterations focused on refining the input validation (changing from `ValidationException` to `Exception` and finally `ArgumentError`), clarifying the error message, and improving code style. The final version uses `ArgumentError` and ensures the `articleId` is greater than 0.  A brief period where the file was entirely emptied is also noted at 12:35:39 PM.

A new test file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/domain/usecase/get_solution_article_detail_use_case_test.dart`, was created at 12:42 PM, reflecting the implementation of unit tests for the use case following a DI-based approach.  The associated helper file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/domain/usecase/helper/get_solution_article_detail_use_case_expected_io.dart` was also created at the same time and contains test data.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/instructions/domain/usecase_test_guidelines.instructions.md` file was added at 12:25 PM. This file serves as a guideline for creating use case tests, emphasizing the use of Mockoon for generating realistic API responses.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/demo.md` file was updated several times between 12:15 PM and 12:16 PM. These updates involved minor improvements to the presentation, including clarifying the use of Copilot Prompts and adding information about the reusability of prompt files.

In summary, the code changes demonstrate an iterative development process involving prompt refinement, use case implementation, and comprehensive unit testing using a dependency injection framework and Mockoon for realistic API simulation. The updates highlight a focus on code quality and best practices in test creation.  The use of a code generation prompt suggests an effort to automate parts of the development process.


## 1:23:17 PM
The provided log shows multiple revisions of a markdown file detailing guidelines for creating and testing UseCases in a Flutter project.  The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/instructions/domain/usecase_guidelines.instructions.md` underwent several edits between 11:30:22 AM and 11:49:28 AM on July 18, 2025.  The key changes revolve around clarifying file references for the `UseCase` and `UCResult` classes, improving the structure and adding detail to the code generation rules, and finally adding a "Refer" section in place of "File references".  The file path to the `UseCase` class changes from a relative path to an absolute path within the project's library structure (`../../../libraries/core_lib/core/lib/src/domain/usecase/use_case.dart`). Similarly, the path to the `UCResult` class is updated to reflect its location within the `domain/model` subdirectory.  No substantive changes are made to the examples of UseCases or DI registration.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/instructions/domain/usecase_test_guidelines.instructions.md` was also revised between 11:35:03 AM and 12:03:58 PM on the same day.  Significant changes involved a shift in testing methodology from traditional mocking to a Mockoon-based approach using DI modules. The initial revisions describe using Mockito for mocking, but later versions strongly advocate for Mockoon for providing realistic API responses.  The documentation is significantly expanded to include detailed instructions on using Mockoon,  specifying query parameters to target specific Mockoon responses and the location of those responses (`freshservice_mobile_api_mock/freshservice_data.json`). The emphasis is on using DI modules to inject the Mockoon-configured repositories, simplifying test setup and making the tests more robust and maintainable.  The guidelines for test structure and example implementations are consistently updated to reflect the Mockoon-based DI approach.  Later revisions refined the documentation for Mockoon response management and added more detail to the code generation rules for test files.  In the final version, the use of mock-based testing using `mockito` is explicitly discouraged in favor of Mockoon-based testing.


## 3:23:08 PM
This markdown file details a prompt for generating Flutter data layer code from user input.  The process involves four main steps: gathering user input about a single CRUD operation (module details, request details including enums and mandatory/default fields, and response details), parsing that input, presenting a confirmation checklist for user review and editing, and finally generating the code components (API constants, request/response models, mappers, data source, and repository).  The input includes a cURL command, JSON response, and specifications for enums and date/time fields.  The code generation is guided by several referenced guideline documents (e.g., `remote_api_constants_guidelines.instructions.md`), ensuring consistent code structure. The example provided uses a GET request to `/support/v2/tickets` demonstrating how various components of the response are handled, including nested objects and enums.  A crucial part of the process is user confirmation before code generation, allowing for corrections.  The timestamp indicates the prompt was last updated on July 18th, 2025.


## 8:06:28 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, specifically within the `support_portal` feature and the `solution_lib` library.  The changes span from 4:38 PM to 4:56 PM on July 18, 2025.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/solution/folder/view/component/content/folder_list_content.dart` file underwent multiple revisions.  The key changes involved updating the import statement to include `solution_lib/res/solution_lib_ui_images.dart` and later `solution_lib/solution_lib.dart`, reflecting a refactoring to use images and potentially other components from the `solution_lib` library.  Additionally, the `NoItemsFoundIndicator`'s `message` property's localization changed from `context.supportPortalLoc` to `context.solutionLibLoc`.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/solution_lib.dart` file was modified to simplify the path to its resource files, removing the redundant `libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/res/` prefix.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/solution_v2/article/view/components/article_item.dart` file saw minor corrections, primarily fixing a syntax error in the `FSListTile` widget's `title` property.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/src/ui/solution_folder_list/view/solution_folder_list_folder_item.dart` file was updated to improve code structure and use the `FSListTile` widget instead of a `ListTile` and to change image size constants from numerical values to `space24`. The `subTitle` property was also corrected.

Finally, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/src/ui/solution_folder_list/model/solution_folder_list_event.dart` file shows the addition of `localizations` parameter in the `SolutionFolderListEventLoadFolders` class.  This suggests improved localization handling within the application.  The version number in the class name (`SolutionFolderListEventV2`) was also removed in a later commit.


Overall, the changes suggest a focused effort on improving code quality, consistency, and maintainability by refactoring imports, correcting minor syntax issues, and improving localization handling within the solution folder list component.  The use of the `FSListTile` widget points to a consistent UI component being used throughout the project.
