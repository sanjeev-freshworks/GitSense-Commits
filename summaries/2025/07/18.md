# Activity Summary for 7/18/2025

## 3:10:40 AM
The log shows code changes related to the development of an "Agent Article Detail" feature in a Flutter mobile application.  The changes span several files and primarily focus on the presentation layer (model, bloc, UI mapper).

Between 10:55 PM and 11:00 PM, prompts were generated for code generation of the model, bloc, and UI mapper for the `Agent Article Detail` feature. These prompts utilize  `generic_presentation_layer_models_codegen.prompt`, `generic_presentation_layer_bloc_codegen.prompt`, and `generic_presentation_layer_ui_mapper_codegen.prompt` as templates.  The inputs across all prompts are consistent, referencing a localization file (`intl_en.arb`), PRD, and tech design documents. The `intl_en.arb` file was updated incrementally between 10:56 PM and 10:59 PM, adding keys for article information (created on, modified by, location, author, workspace, views, helpful and not helpful counts), and their corresponding placeholders.

Between 11:01 PM and 11:17 PM, several Dart files were added or updated. `article_detail_navigation_state.dart` defines navigation states for actions like downloading attachments, viewing categories/folders/author profiles, editing articles, closing popups, and sending results. `article_detail_ui_state.dart` defines the UI states (loading, content, error).  `article_detail_ui_event.dart` outlines events for loading, refreshing, downloading attachments, and navigation actions.  `article_detail_ui_model.dart` defines data models for article detail and attachments.   The UI mapper prompt was also repeatedly modified between 11:08 PM and 11:08 PM, clarifying the location of the `ArticleDetailModel`. Finally, `article_detail_ui_model.dart` was modified slightly between 11:11 PM and 11:17 PM, but the changes are minor and appear to be formatting adjustments rather than functional changes.

A test fixture (`article_detail_fixture.dart`) and associated tests (`article_detail_ui_mapper_test.dart`) were added between 11:17 PM and 11:20 PM, to validate the mapping of the data model to the UI model.   These tests cover various scenarios, including null or empty values in the data model. The tests were further refined between 11:18 PM and 11:20 PM, fixing minor issues.

Between 11:25 PM and 11:28 PM, the bloc prompt was re-run, possibly to address minor issues or to incorporate changes made since the initial prompt execution. Lastly, between 11:33 PM and 11:40 PM, the `article_detail_bloc.dart` file underwent significant updates to implement the bloc logic, handling various events, including loading article details, refreshing the screen, downloading attachments, navigation, and action selection. The bloc makes use of analytics tracking for different events.  The implementation in `article_detail_bloc.dart` changed between 11:33 PM and 11:40 PM to include error handling, a switch case for use case results, and to properly handle navigation state changes from different event types. Finally, a test file `article_detail_bloc_test.dart` was added at 11:41 PM, which includes tests for the bloc's behavior when handling different events.  Minor edits were done in the test between 11:41 PM and 11:42 PM, clarifying some expectations and imports.
