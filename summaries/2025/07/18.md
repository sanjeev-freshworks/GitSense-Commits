# Activity Summary for 7/18/2025

## 3:10:40 AM
The log shows code changes related to the development of an "Agent Article Detail" feature in a Flutter mobile application.  The changes span several files and primarily focus on the presentation layer (model, bloc, UI mapper).

Between 10:55 PM and 11:00 PM, prompts were generated for code generation of the model, bloc, and UI mapper for the `Agent Article Detail` feature. These prompts utilize  `generic_presentation_layer_models_codegen.prompt`, `generic_presentation_layer_bloc_codegen.prompt`, and `generic_presentation_layer_ui_mapper_codegen.prompt` as templates.  The inputs across all prompts are consistent, referencing a localization file (`intl_en.arb`), PRD, and tech design documents. The `intl_en.arb` file was updated incrementally between 10:56 PM and 10:59 PM, adding keys for article information (created on, modified by, location, author, workspace, views, helpful and not helpful counts), and their corresponding placeholders.

Between 11:01 PM and 11:17 PM, several Dart files were added or updated. `article_detail_navigation_state.dart` defines navigation states for actions like downloading attachments, viewing categories/folders/author profiles, editing articles, closing popups, and sending results. `article_detail_ui_state.dart` defines the UI states (loading, content, error).  `article_detail_ui_event.dart` outlines events for loading, refreshing, downloading attachments, and navigation actions.  `article_detail_ui_model.dart` defines data models for article detail and attachments.   The UI mapper prompt was also repeatedly modified between 11:08 PM and 11:08 PM, clarifying the location of the `ArticleDetailModel`. Finally, `article_detail_ui_model.dart` was modified slightly between 11:11 PM and 11:17 PM, but the changes are minor and appear to be formatting adjustments rather than functional changes.

A test fixture (`article_detail_fixture.dart`) and associated tests (`article_detail_ui_mapper_test.dart`) were added between 11:17 PM and 11:20 PM, to validate the mapping of the data model to the UI model.   These tests cover various scenarios, including null or empty values in the data model. The tests were further refined between 11:18 PM and 11:20 PM, fixing minor issues.

Between 11:25 PM and 11:28 PM, the bloc prompt was re-run, possibly to address minor issues or to incorporate changes made since the initial prompt execution. Lastly, between 11:33 PM and 11:40 PM, the `article_detail_bloc.dart` file underwent significant updates to implement the bloc logic, handling various events, including loading article details, refreshing the screen, downloading attachments, navigation, and action selection. The bloc makes use of analytics tracking for different events.  The implementation in `article_detail_bloc.dart` changed between 11:33 PM and 11:40 PM to include error handling, a switch case for use case results, and to properly handle navigation state changes from different event types. Finally, a test file `article_detail_bloc_test.dart` was added at 11:41 PM, which includes tests for the bloc's behavior when handling different events.  Minor edits were done in the test between 11:41 PM and 11:42 PM, clarifying some expectations and imports.


## 12:07:13 PM
The log shows iterative modifications to a `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/demo.md` file documenting a GitHub Copilot Agent demo for code generation within a Flutter project.  The initial versions (10:50:53 AM to 10:51:39 AM) focus on showcasing Copilot's capabilities in generating code for Data, Domain, and Presentation layers of a simple epic, reducing development time from 16 days to 9 days.  The demo highlights Copilot's different modes (Ask, Edit, Agent) and the challenges faced, such as difficulties with the Presentation Layer and occasional generation of incomplete or incorrect code.  The  `demo.md` file is further refined between 11:17:30 AM and 11:20:26 AM, adding a "Resources" section with a link to Copilot customization documentation and clarifying the types of instruction files (workspace vs. user).  Finally, at 11:20:26 AM, the description of Copilot instructions is improved to better explain custom instructions and their usage.

Two additional files, `usecase_guidelines.instructions.md` (11:43:34 AM) and `usecase_test_guidelines.instructions.md` (11:43:49 AM, further updated at 11:51:26 AM, 11:51:36 AM, and 11:56:20 AM), provide detailed instructions for creating and testing UseCases in the project. `usecase_guidelines.instructions.md` gives a thorough explanation of the expected structure, best practices, dependency injection, and file organization for creating UseCases within the Clean Architecture.  `usecase_test_guidelines.instructions.md` initially detailed a testing approach using Mockoon responses via dependency injection but later versions shifted to explain both Mockoon-based testing and traditional mocking with Mockito, providing various test structures and examples along with best practices.  The final version (12:04:25 PM) of `usecase_test_guidelines.instructions.md` emphasizes Mockoon-based testing for its integration testing benefits. Finally, at 12:04:38 PM and 12:06:30 PM, two prompt files `usecase_codegen.prompt.md` and `sample_usecase_codegen.prompt.md` are added detailing how to gather input, parse, and use the input to generate UseCases in the project.  The second prompt file provides a sample use case for generating code.  The overall pattern across all these files suggests a focus on streamlining development and testing processes using AI-assisted tools.
