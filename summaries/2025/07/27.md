# Activity Summary for 7/27/2025

## 12:25:40 AM
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, primarily focusing on the `launch.json` file and the `folder_detail` feature.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json`**: This file underwent several revisions between 11:28 PM and 11:41 PM on July 26, 2025.  The main change involved adding and removing a "Flutter Attach to Module" configuration.  The configurations for "FS Module Dev", "FS Sdk Dev", and "Golden" remained largely consistent throughout these revisions.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/`**:  This directory's files (`folder_detail_screen_root.dart`, `folder_detail_event.dart`, `folder_detail_bloc.dart`, `folder_detail_screen.dart`, `components/folder_info_widget.dart`, and `model/folder_info_ui_model.dart`) were modified between 11:45 PM on July 26, 2025, and 12:25 AM on July 27, 2025.  These changes suggest a significant update to the folder detail UI and its associated logic.

**Specific File Changes Summary:**

* **`folder_detail_screen_root.dart`**:  Added an info button to the app bar that triggers a `FolderDetailEventFolderInfoClicked` event.  This event was initially intended to show a modal bottom sheet, but this was later removed.

* **`folder_detail_event.dart`**: Added a `FolderDetailEventFolderInfoClicked` event which takes localization parameters.

* **`folder_detail_bloc.dart`**:  The most substantial changes were in this file.  This involved adding the handling of the new `FolderDetailEventFolderInfoClicked` event to load and display folder information using the `_getSolutionFolderInfoUseCase`.  Error handling and logging were also added, using `FSLogger`.  The handling of navigation states was refined, notably incorporating `FolderDetailNavigationStateOpenFolderInfoBottomSheet`.  There were several minor edits throughout the file to improve code style and functionality.

* **`folder_detail_screen.dart`**:  This file handles the display of the folder detail screen and manages navigation based on the bloc's state.  The key change was the addition of the `FolderDetailNavigationStateOpenFolderInfoBottomSheet` case to the `_listenState` function, integrating the new bottom sheet functionality, which initially used  `fsShowModalBottomSheet` but was not completed.  The implementation shows a placeholder text ("Hello Siderfighter").

* **`components/folder_info_widget.dart`**: This component was created to display folder information in a bottom sheet.  The initial version was a placeholder.  Subsequent revisions built out the UI to display the folder name, description, category, article count, and subfolder count, using themed styling from `core_ui`.

* **`model/folder_info_ui_model.dart`**: This model was added to represent the UI specific folder info and uses Freezed for data immutability.  The initial version had a typo, and it was corrected in subsequent commits.



**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Extensive use of `context.theme` and themed styles from a `core_ui` package for consistent UI design.
* Use of  `SolutionLibLocalizations` and `CommonUILocalizations` for internationalization.
* Leveraging the `flutter_bloc` package for state management.
* Consistent use of the  `freezed` annotation for immutable data models.
* Frequent logging using `FSLogger` for debugging.


The overall changes indicate a substantial enhancement to the solution folder detail view, adding a feature to display detailed folder information in a bottom sheet.  The development process involved iterative refinement and debugging, with numerous minor code adjustments.


## 1:25:46 AM
The log shows iterative changes to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/folder_info_widget.dart` between 12:27 AM and 1:25 AM on July 27, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is the development of a `FolderInfoWidget` in Flutter.

Initially, the widget's `build` method was empty.  Subsequent commits added sections:  `_buildHeader`, `_buildFolderLocation`, and `_buildFolderDetails`. `_buildFolderDetails` started as an empty `Column` and progressively gained rows (`Row`) displaying folder details such as "Managed By," "Visible To," "Folders," and "Articles."  The `_buildFolderDetailItem` function was introduced to create reusable UI elements for these details, each consisting of a label and value.

Significant changes include:

* **12:27:24 AM:**  The `_buildFolderDetails` method was fleshed out with a `Column` and `Row` structure.
* **12:28:22 AM:** The `_buildFolderDetailItem` helper function was added.
* **12:29:25 AM:** Changes to text color styling, particularly the color for category names.
* **12:33:54 AM:** The `build` method of `FolderInfoWidget` was completed, combining header, location and details sections.
* **12:41:20 AM:** Addition of a `Divider` to the header.
* **12:41:47 AM and 12:42:16 AM:**  Spacing adjustments using `SizedBox` with `space8`, `space4`, `space24`, and `space20` constants.
* **12:47:35 AM and 12:48:02 AM:** Refinement of layout using `MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween` and `MainAxisSize.max` in `_buildFolderDetails` to improve spacing and alignment of details.
* **12:49:40 AM – 12:53:52 AM:**  Further layout adjustments, specifically in `_buildFolderDetails` and `_buildFolderDetailItem`, focusing on `MainAxisAlignment` and `CrossAxisAlignment` within `Row` and `Column` elements.  `Expanded` was also introduced to make the layout more responsive.
* **1:22:13 AM – 1:25:14 AM:**  `Padding` was added within `_buildFolderDetailItem` for better horizontal spacing.


Throughout the changes, there's a consistent use of Flutter's layout widgets (`Column`, `Row`, `Padding`, `Expanded`), styling using `ThemeData` (specifically `fsTextTheme` and `fsColorScheme`), and the use of named constants (`space8`, `space20`, etc.) for spacing.  The `_buildFolderDetailItem` function remains largely unchanged in its structure after its creation.  The biggest structural change happened at around 12:33:54 AM where the main `build` method of the widget was populated.  The use of `folderInfo` object to retrieve data for the UI consistently is observed.  There are several instances where placeholder text ("folderInfo.managedBy", etc.) was used temporarily and later replaced with correct code.  The final change seems to address responsive layout and text overflow within the `Expanded` widget.
