# Activity Summary for 7/27/2025

## 12:25:40 AM
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, primarily focusing on the `launch.json` file and the `folder_detail` feature.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json`**: This file underwent several revisions between 11:28 PM and 11:41 PM on July 26, 2025.  The main change involved adding and removing a "Flutter Attach to Module" configuration.  The configurations for "FS Module Dev", "FS Sdk Dev", and "Golden" remained largely consistent throughout these revisions.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/`**:  This directory's files (`folder_detail_screen_root.dart`, `folder_detail_event.dart`, `folder_detail_bloc.dart`, `folder_detail_screen.dart`, `components/folder_info_widget.dart`, and `model/folder_info_ui_model.dart`) were modified between 11:45 PM on July 26, 2025, and 12:25 AM on July 27, 2025.  These changes suggest a significant update to the folder detail UI and its associated logic.

**Specific File Changes Summary:**

* **`folder_detail_screen_root.dart`**:  Added an info button to the app bar that triggers a `FolderDetailEventFolderInfoClicked` event.  This event was initially intended to show a modal bottom sheet, but this was later removed.

* **`folder_detail_event.dart`**: Added a `FolderDetailEventFolderInfoClicked` event which takes localization parameters.

* **`folder_detail_bloc.dart`**:  The most substantial changes were in this file.  This involved adding the handling of the new `FolderDetailEventFolderInfoClicked` event to load and display folder information using the `_getSolutionFolderInfoUseCase`.  Error handling and logging were also added, using `FSLogger`.  The handling of navigation states was refined, notably incorporating `FolderDetailNavigationStateOpenFolderInfoBottomSheet`.  There were several minor edits throughout the file to improve code style and functionality.

* **`folder_detail_screen.dart`**:  This file handles the display of the folder detail screen and manages navigation based on the bloc's state.  The key change was the addition of the `FolderDetailNavigationStateOpenFolderInfoBottomSheet` case to the `_listenState` function, integrating the new bottom sheet functionality, which initially used  `fsShowModalBottomSheet` but was not completed.  The implementation shows a placeholder text ("Hello Siderfighter").

* **`components/folder_info_widget.dart`**: This component was created to display folder information in a bottom sheet.  The initial version was a placeholder.  Subsequent revisions built out the UI to display the folder name, description, category, article count, and subfolder count, using themed styling from `core_ui`.

* **`model/folder_info_ui_model.dart`**: This model was added to represent the UI specific folder info and uses Freezed for data immutability.  The initial version had a typo, and it was corrected in subsequent commits.



**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Extensive use of `context.theme` and themed styles from a `core_ui` package for consistent UI design.
* Use of  `SolutionLibLocalizations` and `CommonUILocalizations` for internationalization.
* Leveraging the `flutter_bloc` package for state management.
* Consistent use of the  `freezed` annotation for immutable data models.
* Frequent logging using `FSLogger` for debugging.


The overall changes indicate a substantial enhancement to the solution folder detail view, adding a feature to display detailed folder information in a bottom sheet.  The development process involved iterative refinement and debugging, with numerous minor code adjustments.
