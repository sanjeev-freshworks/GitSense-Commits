# Activity Summary for 7/27/2025

## 12:25:40 AM
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, primarily focusing on the `launch.json` file and the `folder_detail` feature.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/launch.json`**: This file underwent several revisions between 11:28 PM and 11:41 PM on July 26, 2025.  The main change involved adding and removing a "Flutter Attach to Module" configuration.  The configurations for "FS Module Dev", "FS Sdk Dev", and "Golden" remained largely consistent throughout these revisions.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/`**:  This directory's files (`folder_detail_screen_root.dart`, `folder_detail_event.dart`, `folder_detail_bloc.dart`, `folder_detail_screen.dart`, `components/folder_info_widget.dart`, and `model/folder_info_ui_model.dart`) were modified between 11:45 PM on July 26, 2025, and 12:25 AM on July 27, 2025.  These changes suggest a significant update to the folder detail UI and its associated logic.

**Specific File Changes Summary:**

* **`folder_detail_screen_root.dart`**:  Added an info button to the app bar that triggers a `FolderDetailEventFolderInfoClicked` event.  This event was initially intended to show a modal bottom sheet, but this was later removed.

* **`folder_detail_event.dart`**: Added a `FolderDetailEventFolderInfoClicked` event which takes localization parameters.

* **`folder_detail_bloc.dart`**:  The most substantial changes were in this file.  This involved adding the handling of the new `FolderDetailEventFolderInfoClicked` event to load and display folder information using the `_getSolutionFolderInfoUseCase`.  Error handling and logging were also added, using `FSLogger`.  The handling of navigation states was refined, notably incorporating `FolderDetailNavigationStateOpenFolderInfoBottomSheet`.  There were several minor edits throughout the file to improve code style and functionality.

* **`folder_detail_screen.dart`**:  This file handles the display of the folder detail screen and manages navigation based on the bloc's state.  The key change was the addition of the `FolderDetailNavigationStateOpenFolderInfoBottomSheet` case to the `_listenState` function, integrating the new bottom sheet functionality, which initially used  `fsShowModalBottomSheet` but was not completed.  The implementation shows a placeholder text ("Hello Siderfighter").

* **`components/folder_info_widget.dart`**: This component was created to display folder information in a bottom sheet.  The initial version was a placeholder.  Subsequent revisions built out the UI to display the folder name, description, category, article count, and subfolder count, using themed styling from `core_ui`.

* **`model/folder_info_ui_model.dart`**: This model was added to represent the UI specific folder info and uses Freezed for data immutability.  The initial version had a typo, and it was corrected in subsequent commits.



**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Extensive use of `context.theme` and themed styles from a `core_ui` package for consistent UI design.
* Use of  `SolutionLibLocalizations` and `CommonUILocalizations` for internationalization.
* Leveraging the `flutter_bloc` package for state management.
* Consistent use of the  `freezed` annotation for immutable data models.
* Frequent logging using `FSLogger` for debugging.


The overall changes indicate a substantial enhancement to the solution folder detail view, adding a feature to display detailed folder information in a bottom sheet.  The development process involved iterative refinement and debugging, with numerous minor code adjustments.


## 1:25:46 AM
The log shows iterative changes to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/folder_info_widget.dart` between 12:27 AM and 1:25 AM on July 27, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is the development of a `FolderInfoWidget` in Flutter.

Initially, the widget's `build` method was empty.  Subsequent commits added sections:  `_buildHeader`, `_buildFolderLocation`, and `_buildFolderDetails`. `_buildFolderDetails` started as an empty `Column` and progressively gained rows (`Row`) displaying folder details such as "Managed By," "Visible To," "Folders," and "Articles."  The `_buildFolderDetailItem` function was introduced to create reusable UI elements for these details, each consisting of a label and value.

Significant changes include:

* **12:27:24 AM:**  The `_buildFolderDetails` method was fleshed out with a `Column` and `Row` structure.
* **12:28:22 AM:** The `_buildFolderDetailItem` helper function was added.
* **12:29:25 AM:** Changes to text color styling, particularly the color for category names.
* **12:33:54 AM:** The `build` method of `FolderInfoWidget` was completed, combining header, location and details sections.
* **12:41:20 AM:** Addition of a `Divider` to the header.
* **12:41:47 AM and 12:42:16 AM:**  Spacing adjustments using `SizedBox` with `space8`, `space4`, `space24`, and `space20` constants.
* **12:47:35 AM and 12:48:02 AM:** Refinement of layout using `MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween` and `MainAxisSize.max` in `_buildFolderDetails` to improve spacing and alignment of details.
* **12:49:40 AM – 12:53:52 AM:**  Further layout adjustments, specifically in `_buildFolderDetails` and `_buildFolderDetailItem`, focusing on `MainAxisAlignment` and `CrossAxisAlignment` within `Row` and `Column` elements.  `Expanded` was also introduced to make the layout more responsive.
* **1:22:13 AM – 1:25:14 AM:**  `Padding` was added within `_buildFolderDetailItem` for better horizontal spacing.


Throughout the changes, there's a consistent use of Flutter's layout widgets (`Column`, `Row`, `Padding`, `Expanded`), styling using `ThemeData` (specifically `fsTextTheme` and `fsColorScheme`), and the use of named constants (`space8`, `space20`, etc.) for spacing.  The `_buildFolderDetailItem` function remains largely unchanged in its structure after its creation.  The biggest structural change happened at around 12:33:54 AM where the main `build` method of the widget was populated.  The use of `folderInfo` object to retrieve data for the UI consistently is observed.  There are several instances where placeholder text ("folderInfo.managedBy", etc.) was used temporarily and later replaced with correct code.  The final change seems to address responsive layout and text overflow within the `Expanded` widget.


## 2:25:47 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/folder_info_widget.dart` file between 1:29 AM and 1:33 AM on July 27, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on refining the UI layout and display of folder information within the `FolderInfoWidget`.  Specifically, the padding in the `build` method was adjusted multiple times, initially using `EdgeInsets.all`, then `EdgeInsets.only`, modifying the top, bottom, left, and right padding values.  Also, a `Divider` widget was added and subsequently removed from the `_buildHeader` method.

Between 1:44 AM and 1:44 AM on July 27, 2025, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/folder_info_api_model_mapper.dart` file underwent minor modification.  A comment (`//fixme: toPirate`) was removed from the `_mapVisibility` function, suggesting a fix related to the mapping of folder visibility.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/mapper/folder_info_ui_model_mapper.dart` file was updated at 1:45 AM and 1:51 AM on July 27, 2025. These changes involved handling different visibility states in the `_getVisibilityText` function and adding `.toPirate` to a string in `_getVisibleWorkspaceText` at 1:51 AM.


At 1:47 AM on July 27, 2025, the internationalization file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` was updated.  This commit added or modified several localized strings, including those for folder location, folder counts, article counts, managed by, and visible to.  Notable is the addition of placeholders for dynamic text substitution.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/bloc/folder_detail_bloc.dart` file saw modifications at 1:54 AM, 1:58 AM and 2:21 AM on July 27, 2025.  These changes primarily involved improvements to error handling and logging within the bloc, along with some restructuring of the code for better readability. A logging statement was added using `FSLogger` at 1:58 AM, and error handling was enhanced at 2:21 AM by adding the `FolderDetailNavigationState.folderInfoError` state to the bloc's handling of the folder info API call.

Finally, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/folder_detail_screen.dart` file underwent numerous revisions between 2:02 AM and 2:23 AM on July 27, 2025.  The main focus was improving the handling of UI updates and navigation based on the `FolderDetailNavigationState`.  The logging of snackbar messages was improved by adding the message itself to the log message.  Additionally, a `case` was added in the `_listenState` function to handle the `FolderDetailNavigationStateFolderInfoError` state at 2:23 AM.  The changes demonstrate a progressive refinement of error handling and logging for UI updates and navigation within the `FolderDetailScreen`.


## 3:25:45 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory, specifically focusing on the `folder_detail` feature's UI and Bloc.  The changes span from 2:26 AM to 3:25 AM on July 27, 2025.

The `/folder_detail/presentation/model/folder_detail_state.dart` file was updated twice (at 2:26 AM and 2:55 AM). The second update added a `userMessage` field to the `FolderDetailStateContent` class, suggesting the implementation of error handling or user feedback mechanisms.

The `/folder_detail/view/folder_detail_screen.dart` file underwent numerous revisions (2:27 AM, 2:32 AM, 2:33 AM, 2:37 AM, 2:37 AM, 2:39 AM, 2:40 AM, 3:05 AM, 3:06 AM, 3:09 AM, 3:10 AM, 3:14 AM, 3:16 AM, 3:17 AM, 3:17 AM, and 3:19 AM).  These changes primarily involved refining the `_listenState` function to handle different `FolderDetailNavigationState` enum values and display snackbars using `ScaffoldMessenger` when `userMessage` is not null.  The  `_shouldlListen` function was also adjusted to improve the responsiveness of the UI based on changes in  `navigationState` and `userMessage`.


The `/folder_detail/view/folder_detail_screen_root.dart` file was updated once (at 2:28 AM), adding an `AppBar` with an info button that triggers a `FolderDetailEventFolderInfoClicked` event.

The `/folder_detail/presentation/bloc/folder_detail_bloc.dart` file was modified extensively (2:37 AM, 2:41 AM, 2:41 AM, 2:44 AM, 2:44 AM, 2:45 AM, 2:45 AM, 2:49 AM, 2:51 AM, 3:20 AM, 3:22 AM, 3:22 AM, 3:24 AM, 3:24 AM, 3:25 AM). The major changes in this file involve:

*   Adding handling for `userMessage` in the Bloc to manage and propagate error messages.
*   Implementing error handling within the `_onFolderInfoClicked` function, which now updates the UI with a `userMessage` if an error occurs during the `_getSolutionFolderInfoUseCase`.
*   Refactoring of code and adding helper methods.
*   Adding a `_updateUIContentState` helper function to efficiently update the `contentState` with the `userMessage`.


The `/folder_detail/presentation/model/folder_detail_navigation_state.dart` file was updated once (at 2:36 AM). This update likely expanded the functionality by adding new navigation states.

The changes exhibit a clear pattern of iterative development and debugging, with multiple small commits focusing on refining the UI's response to different states and improving error handling. The use of Bloc pattern is prevalent throughout the code changes.  The repeated updates to `folder_detail_screen.dart` and `folder_detail_bloc.dart` indicate a close relationship between the view and the business logic.  The consistent use of logging (`FSLogger`) throughout suggests a deliberate effort in debugging and monitoring the application's behavior.


## 5:25:27 AM
The log shows a series of rapid modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/bloc/folder_detail_bloc.dart` file between 3:26 AM and 3:30 AM on July 27, 2025.  These changes primarily involve refactoring the code to use a single `_updateUIContentState` function instead of directly emitting state changes in multiple event handlers. This function updates the UI content state with a new `contentState` and an optional `userMessage`.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/folder_detail_content.dart` file was also updated twice between 3:36 AM and 3:36:30 AM on the same day.  The key change in this file was correcting the event dispatched on refresh from `RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated` to `FolderDetailEventViewCreated`.

Finally, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_list/view/folder_list_content.dart` file underwent two minor updates between 3:37 AM and 3:37:50 AM on July 27, 2025.  These were likely minor formatting or stylistic changes, as the core functionality appears unchanged.  The file uses `PagedListView` for displaying a list of folders, handling page requests, errors, and empty state scenarios.  There were no functional changes made in this file during this period.

The overall pattern across all modifications points to a focused effort on improving the structure and maintainability of the `folder_detail_bloc.dart` file through code refactoring and consistent use of the `_updateUIContentState` function.  The other file updates appear to be smaller, related adjustments.


## 10:51:03 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/folder_detail_screen.dart` between 10:46 AM and 10:50 AM on July 27, 2025.  The primary changes involve the `onFolderLocationClicked` callback within the `FolderInfoWidget` used in `FolderDetailScreen`.

Initially, this callback was not implemented.  Subsequent revisions integrated `go_router` to handle navigation. The `onFolderLocationClicked` was updated to use `GoRouter.of(context).go(location)` and then `GoRouter.of(context).goNamed(location)`, before finally settling on `GoRouter.of(context).goNamed(SolutionPaths.folderList)`.  A final revision removed the navigation entirely from this function, leaving it commented out.

The `folder_detail_screen.dart` file consistently uses the BLoC pattern for state management, handling various navigation states (opening folder details, articles, external URLs, and a folder info bottom sheet), and displaying user messages via snackbars.  The `folder_info_widget.dart` file, updated once at 10:48:05 AM, displays detailed folder information.  There is a consistent use of custom widgets and styling (`core_ui`, `common_ui`), logging (`fs_logger`), and localization (`solution_lib_localizations_getter`).  No significant changes occurred in `folder_info_widget.dart` after its initial commit.


## 11:51:08 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory, primarily focusing on the `folder_detail_screen.dart` file and related data models and mappers.

The `folder_detail_screen.dart` file underwent multiple revisions between 10:51 AM and 11:33 AM on July 27, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent:  handling navigation based on `FolderDetailNavigationState` within a `BlocConsumer`.  Changes primarily involved the `onFolderLocationClicked` callback within the `FolderInfoWidget` in the bottom sheet.  Initially, this callback was commented out or contained placeholders.  Subsequent revisions added logging statements using `FSLogger.logWithTag("siderfighter", ...)` to track clicks.  The navigation target within the callback shifted between using `FolderListScreenRoute().go(context)` and `FolderListScreenRoute().push(context)`, with some intermediary attempts involving `CategoryListScreenRoute` that were later removed.  The final version consistently uses `FolderListScreenRoute` with `categoryId` and `categoryName` to navigate.

A `folder_info_ui_model.dart` file was created at 10:53 AM, defining a data model for folder information using the `freezed` package.  This model was subsequently updated at 10:57 AM to remove the `String visibility` field, replacing it with a `int categoryId` field.

Multiple files related to data handling were modified:

- `folder_info_api_model.dart` (10:54 AM):  Defines API models for folder information using `json_annotation`. This includes nested models for departments, groups, and manage-by groups.
- `folder_info.dart` (10:55 AM):  Defines a data model for folder information using `freezed`, containing fields such as description, name, visibility, group IDs and more.  Two nearly identical entries exist, separated by only a few seconds.
- `folder_info_api_model_mapper.dart` (10:56 AM and 11:26 AM, 11:32 AM): This mapper converts between the API models and the data models, handling the mapping of visibility integers to an enum (`FolderVisibility`). This mapper also underwent changes, initially having a `categoryId` defaulting to -1 and later changed to `folder?.categoryId ?? -1` in the latest commit.

Finally, `folder_info_ui_model_mapper.dart` (10:57 AM) shows a mapper responsible for converting the `FolderInfo` data model to the `FolderInfoUiModel` for presentation. This mapper handles localization and formatting of visibility and managed-by information.

In summary, the code changes reflect a focused effort on refining the data flow and navigation within the Folder Detail screen, specifically improving the handling of folder location clicks and the data transformations between API responses, data models, and UI models. The frequent changes in `folder_detail_screen.dart` might indicate iterative debugging and refinement of the navigation logic.  The consistent use of `FSLogger` suggests a deliberate approach to tracking and debugging the application's behavior.


## 1:51:17 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/folder_info_widget.dart` between 1:10 PM and 1:14 PM on July 27, 2025.  These changes primarily involved adding a section to display the folder description if available, using `headerWidgets.addAll` to efficiently manage widget additions to the header.  The initial versions lacked this feature. The `import` statement for `http_client/http_client.dart` was briefly added and then removed.

Between 1:15 PM and 1:16 PM on July 27, 2025, the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/folder_info.dart` underwent a minor change: the `description` field's type was modified from `String?` to `String?`. This makes the description field optional.

At 1:16 PM on July 27, 2025,  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/folder_info_api_model_mapper.dart` was updated. This mapper handles the transformation of data from the API response (`FolderInfoApiModel`) to the data model (`FolderInfo`).  The update likely involved handling nullable values and conversions between different data types consistently.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/bloc/folder_detail_bloc.dart` was modified at 1:22 PM on July 27, 2025. This is a significant change to the Bloc, introducing more event handling (for clicks on articles, folders, and external articles) and error handling within the `_onLoadItems` function.  The logic for loading folder info was also added to this Bloc.

Finally, between 1:24 PM and 1:40 PM on July 27, 2025, the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/ui/bloc/folder_detail_bloc_test.dart` was revised multiple times. These changes expand the unit tests for the `FolderDetailBloc` to cover more scenarios and edge cases, including error handling and empty results for loading items and adding tests for the 'FolderInfoClicked' event.  The test fixtures were updated correspondingly in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/testfixture/ui/folder_detail/folder_info_ui_model_mapper_fixture.dart`.  The most notable change here was the addition of a `categoryId` to the `FolderInfoUiModel`.  Several modifications were made to ensure the tests accurately reflected the updated functionality and data structures.
