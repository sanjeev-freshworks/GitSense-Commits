# Activity Summary for 7/17/2025

## 10:14:43 AM
The log shows a series of code changes focused on generating model and UI mapper files for an "Agent Article Detail" feature within a Flutter application (likely Freshservice mobile app).  The majority of changes occur between 9:33 AM and 9:36 AM on July 17, 2025.

The initial change at 9:32 AM involves creating `agent_article_detail_ui_event.dart`, which defines various UI events for the feature, including events for view creation, loading article details, refresh actions, editing articles, handling attachments, category and folder selection, navigation, and handling user messages.

Subsequent changes center around running code generation prompts.  These prompts repeatedly invoke `generic_presentation_layer_models_codegen.prompt` and `generic_presentation_layer_ui_mapper_codegen.prompt`,  providing various inputs such as the feature path (`features/solution`), localization file path (`intl_en.arb`), PRD and technical design document paths.  The `task_specific_notes` parameter consistently emphasizes generating only the presentation layer models and UI mappers for the "Agent Article Detail" feature, assuming the domain and data layers are already complete.  There are several nearly identical invocations of the  `generic_presentation_layer_ui_mapper_codegen.prompt`, differing only slightly in wording of the notes. This suggests iterative refinement of the prompt to achieve the desired result.


## 11:14:42 AM
The log shows updates to UI mapper prompts and a localization file (`intl_en.arb`) between 10:41 AM and 11:01 AM on July 17, 2025.

Initially, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/presentation/uimapper/solution_agent_article_detail_ui_mapper.prompt.md` file was modified twice within a minute.  The first modification lacked specification of UI components, while the second added  `FSTextField`.  Both modifications aimed to generate UI mappers for the "Agent Article Detail" feature using a generic prompt and referencing design documents and localization files.

The `intl_en.arb` file underwent several revisions. The early changes involved adding and removing various article detail related strings.  Around 10:59 AM, a significant update added keys for "createdOn," "lastModifiedBy," "articleLocation," "workspace," "analytics," and pluralized strings for "views," "helpful," and "notHelpful," suggesting the addition of analytics and article metadata to the application.  The subsequent edits to `intl_en.arb` after 11:00 AM appear to be redundant, with identical content.

In summary, the changes reflect development of the "Agent Article Detail" feature, involving UI mapper generation and the addition of analytics and detailed article information.  The repeated edits to the `intl_en.arb` file after 10:59 AM could indicate some minor version control or synchronization issues.


## 12:14:50 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project.  The earliest changes (7/17/2025, 11:23 AM - 11:25 AM) involve updating the English localization file (`intl_en.arb`) with various UI strings related to solutions and articles.  No changes were made to the content of the file across these updates; it remained identical in each instance.

Later changes, starting at 11:29 AM, concern the generation of presentation layer code (model and bloc) for an "Agent Article Detail" feature within the "features/solution" module.  Multiple edits to the prompt file (`solution_agent_article_detail_bloc.prompt.md`) refine the feature path specification for code generation.

Subsequently, significant modifications were made to the `agent_article_detail_bloc.dart` file (between 11:33 AM and 11:54 AM). These updates demonstrate the development of a Flutter bloc for the "Agent Article Detail" feature.  The bloc handles various events such as `OnViewCreated`, `LoadDetail`, `Refresh`, `EditArticle`, `AttachmentClicked`, `UploadAttachment`, `CategorySelect`, `FolderSelect`, `ViewRelatedArticles`, `NavigationAndUserMsgHandled`, and `Back`.  The code evolved to include error handling within the `_onLoadDetail` and `_onRefresh` functions, utilizing a `UCResult` type for result handling and improved error reporting.  Event handlers gradually moved from stubs to functional implementations; the `_onAttachmentClicked`, `_onEditArticle`, `_onUploadAttachment`, `_onCategorySelect`, and `_onFolderSelect` functions eventually had navigation logic incorporated.  The `_onViewRelatedArticles` function was also implemented.  Finally, the `AgentArticleDetailUIMapper` dependency was removed.

The final changes (11:54 AM-11:54 AM) show the bloc with its final implementation.

Finally, a unit test file (`agent_article_detail_bloc_test.dart`) was created and updated at 12:00 PM, showcasing tests for the newly implemented bloc using Mockito for mocking dependencies and BlocTest for bloc testing.  A new use case (`get_solution_subfolders_and_articles_use_case.dart`) was also added.  The technical design diagrams describe various aspects of the solution revamp, including UI mockups and domain, bloc, and use case diagrams for different features.  A separate prompt file guides the use case code generation process, emphasizing a step-by-step approach with user input and confirmation.


## 1:14:48 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a markdown file (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/domain/usecase_codegen.prompt.md`) detailing a prompt for generating Flutter UseCase code.  The prompt guides users through gathering information, parsing input and a tech design document, confirming the collected details, and finally generating code components (parameter class, UseCase implementation, dependency injection registration, and unit tests).  The significant changes track the evolution of the prompt's instructions, primarily focusing on clarifying the input required from the user and how much information should be extracted from the tech design document versus explicitly provided by the user.

Early revisions (timestamps between 12:14:56 PM and 12:16:18 PM) focused on a more user-driven input process, requesting extensive detail from the user.  Later revisions (timestamps from 12:21:14 PM onwards) shifted to a more automated approach, emphasizing the extraction of information directly from the provided "Tech Design Document," minimizing the need for explicit user input.  This is evident in the repeated modification of phrases such as  "Request the following information from the user" changing to  "Extract from tech design doc" or  "Infer from tech design doc".

A key change introduced around 12:25:53 PM was the addition of "Task Specific Notes" as mandatory input. This section clarifies the implementation scope, specifying the precise sections or features from the tech design document to be covered by the use case. This addition significantly refined the process, ensuring the generated code focuses only on the required aspects of the design document.  Finally, the prompt structure remained largely consistent throughout all revisions but improvements were made for clarity and efficiency.  The final version (12:28:46 PM) provides a detailed checklist to facilitate user review and confirmation before code generation.  A sample use case (`sample_usecase_codegen.prompt.md`) is included illustrating the entire process.


## 2:14:43 PM
The log shows iterative refinements to a prompt used for generating code, specifically a use case for fetching article details.  The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/domain/sample_usecase_codegen.prompt.md` file underwent numerous revisions between 1:56 PM and 2:13 PM on July 17, 2025.  These revisions primarily focused on the `Unit Test Details` section, changing the `Test Approach` from `MOCK_BASED` to `DI_BASED`.  Additionally, there were several edits removing and adding details about input parameters, dependencies, and return types.  The final version (2:13 PM) included API information from specified JSON and MD files for the `Get Article Detail` API. The file consistently pointed to a tech design document (`tech_design_diagram.md`) for reference.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/usecase/get_article_detail_use_case.dart` file was created and then modified multiple times between 2:05 PM and 2:08 PM on July 17, 2025. The main change within this file was a modification in exception handling within the `protectedExecute` method; the initial version threw `ValidationException` for invalid article IDs, later this was changed to a generic `Exception`. This suggests iterative refinement of error handling.


Finally, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/di/solution_domain_module.dart`  was updated between 1:58 PM and 1:59 PM on July 17, 2025.  This update appears to be a minor cleanup, removing the registration of `GetSolutionArticleDetailUseCase` from the dependency injection module. The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/di/solution_di_module.dart` was updated at 2:09 PM on July 17, 2025, registering various modules for testing purposes.
