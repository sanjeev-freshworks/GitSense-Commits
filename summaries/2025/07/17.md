# Activity Summary for 7/17/2025

## 10:14:43 AM
The log shows a series of code changes focused on generating model and UI mapper files for an "Agent Article Detail" feature within a Flutter application (likely Freshservice mobile app).  The majority of changes occur between 9:33 AM and 9:36 AM on July 17, 2025.

The initial change at 9:32 AM involves creating `agent_article_detail_ui_event.dart`, which defines various UI events for the feature, including events for view creation, loading article details, refresh actions, editing articles, handling attachments, category and folder selection, navigation, and handling user messages.

Subsequent changes center around running code generation prompts.  These prompts repeatedly invoke `generic_presentation_layer_models_codegen.prompt` and `generic_presentation_layer_ui_mapper_codegen.prompt`,  providing various inputs such as the feature path (`features/solution`), localization file path (`intl_en.arb`), PRD and technical design document paths.  The `task_specific_notes` parameter consistently emphasizes generating only the presentation layer models and UI mappers for the "Agent Article Detail" feature, assuming the domain and data layers are already complete.  There are several nearly identical invocations of the  `generic_presentation_layer_ui_mapper_codegen.prompt`, differing only slightly in wording of the notes. This suggests iterative refinement of the prompt to achieve the desired result.


## 11:14:42 AM
The log shows updates to UI mapper prompts and a localization file (`intl_en.arb`) between 10:41 AM and 11:01 AM on July 17, 2025.

Initially, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/presentation/uimapper/solution_agent_article_detail_ui_mapper.prompt.md` file was modified twice within a minute.  The first modification lacked specification of UI components, while the second added  `FSTextField`.  Both modifications aimed to generate UI mappers for the "Agent Article Detail" feature using a generic prompt and referencing design documents and localization files.

The `intl_en.arb` file underwent several revisions. The early changes involved adding and removing various article detail related strings.  Around 10:59 AM, a significant update added keys for "createdOn," "lastModifiedBy," "articleLocation," "workspace," "analytics," and pluralized strings for "views," "helpful," and "notHelpful," suggesting the addition of analytics and article metadata to the application.  The subsequent edits to `intl_en.arb` after 11:00 AM appear to be redundant, with identical content.

In summary, the changes reflect development of the "Agent Article Detail" feature, involving UI mapper generation and the addition of analytics and detailed article information.  The repeated edits to the `intl_en.arb` file after 10:59 AM could indicate some minor version control or synchronization issues.
