# Activity Summary for 7/17/2025

## 10:14:43 AM
The log shows a series of code changes focused on generating model and UI mapper files for an "Agent Article Detail" feature within a Flutter application (likely Freshservice mobile app).  The majority of changes occur between 9:33 AM and 9:36 AM on July 17, 2025.

The initial change at 9:32 AM involves creating `agent_article_detail_ui_event.dart`, which defines various UI events for the feature, including events for view creation, loading article details, refresh actions, editing articles, handling attachments, category and folder selection, navigation, and handling user messages.

Subsequent changes center around running code generation prompts.  These prompts repeatedly invoke `generic_presentation_layer_models_codegen.prompt` and `generic_presentation_layer_ui_mapper_codegen.prompt`,  providing various inputs such as the feature path (`features/solution`), localization file path (`intl_en.arb`), PRD and technical design document paths.  The `task_specific_notes` parameter consistently emphasizes generating only the presentation layer models and UI mappers for the "Agent Article Detail" feature, assuming the domain and data layers are already complete.  There are several nearly identical invocations of the  `generic_presentation_layer_ui_mapper_codegen.prompt`, differing only slightly in wording of the notes. This suggests iterative refinement of the prompt to achieve the desired result.


## 11:14:42 AM
The log shows updates to UI mapper prompts and a localization file (`intl_en.arb`) between 10:41 AM and 11:01 AM on July 17, 2025.

Initially, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/presentation/uimapper/solution_agent_article_detail_ui_mapper.prompt.md` file was modified twice within a minute.  The first modification lacked specification of UI components, while the second added  `FSTextField`.  Both modifications aimed to generate UI mappers for the "Agent Article Detail" feature using a generic prompt and referencing design documents and localization files.

The `intl_en.arb` file underwent several revisions. The early changes involved adding and removing various article detail related strings.  Around 10:59 AM, a significant update added keys for "createdOn," "lastModifiedBy," "articleLocation," "workspace," "analytics," and pluralized strings for "views," "helpful," and "notHelpful," suggesting the addition of analytics and article metadata to the application.  The subsequent edits to `intl_en.arb` after 11:00 AM appear to be redundant, with identical content.

In summary, the changes reflect development of the "Agent Article Detail" feature, involving UI mapper generation and the addition of analytics and detailed article information.  The repeated edits to the `intl_en.arb` file after 10:59 AM could indicate some minor version control or synchronization issues.


## 12:14:50 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project.  The earliest changes (7/17/2025, 11:23 AM - 11:25 AM) involve updating the English localization file (`intl_en.arb`) with various UI strings related to solutions and articles.  No changes were made to the content of the file across these updates; it remained identical in each instance.

Later changes, starting at 11:29 AM, concern the generation of presentation layer code (model and bloc) for an "Agent Article Detail" feature within the "features/solution" module.  Multiple edits to the prompt file (`solution_agent_article_detail_bloc.prompt.md`) refine the feature path specification for code generation.

Subsequently, significant modifications were made to the `agent_article_detail_bloc.dart` file (between 11:33 AM and 11:54 AM). These updates demonstrate the development of a Flutter bloc for the "Agent Article Detail" feature.  The bloc handles various events such as `OnViewCreated`, `LoadDetail`, `Refresh`, `EditArticle`, `AttachmentClicked`, `UploadAttachment`, `CategorySelect`, `FolderSelect`, `ViewRelatedArticles`, `NavigationAndUserMsgHandled`, and `Back`.  The code evolved to include error handling within the `_onLoadDetail` and `_onRefresh` functions, utilizing a `UCResult` type for result handling and improved error reporting.  Event handlers gradually moved from stubs to functional implementations; the `_onAttachmentClicked`, `_onEditArticle`, `_onUploadAttachment`, `_onCategorySelect`, and `_onFolderSelect` functions eventually had navigation logic incorporated.  The `_onViewRelatedArticles` function was also implemented.  Finally, the `AgentArticleDetailUIMapper` dependency was removed.

The final changes (11:54 AM-11:54 AM) show the bloc with its final implementation.

Finally, a unit test file (`agent_article_detail_bloc_test.dart`) was created and updated at 12:00 PM, showcasing tests for the newly implemented bloc using Mockito for mocking dependencies and BlocTest for bloc testing.  A new use case (`get_solution_subfolders_and_articles_use_case.dart`) was also added.  The technical design diagrams describe various aspects of the solution revamp, including UI mockups and domain, bloc, and use case diagrams for different features.  A separate prompt file guides the use case code generation process, emphasizing a step-by-step approach with user input and confirmation.


## 1:14:48 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a markdown file (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/domain/usecase_codegen.prompt.md`) detailing a prompt for generating Flutter UseCase code.  The prompt guides users through gathering information, parsing input and a tech design document, confirming the collected details, and finally generating code components (parameter class, UseCase implementation, dependency injection registration, and unit tests).  The significant changes track the evolution of the prompt's instructions, primarily focusing on clarifying the input required from the user and how much information should be extracted from the tech design document versus explicitly provided by the user.

Early revisions (timestamps between 12:14:56 PM and 12:16:18 PM) focused on a more user-driven input process, requesting extensive detail from the user.  Later revisions (timestamps from 12:21:14 PM onwards) shifted to a more automated approach, emphasizing the extraction of information directly from the provided "Tech Design Document," minimizing the need for explicit user input.  This is evident in the repeated modification of phrases such as  "Request the following information from the user" changing to  "Extract from tech design doc" or  "Infer from tech design doc".

A key change introduced around 12:25:53 PM was the addition of "Task Specific Notes" as mandatory input. This section clarifies the implementation scope, specifying the precise sections or features from the tech design document to be covered by the use case. This addition significantly refined the process, ensuring the generated code focuses only on the required aspects of the design document.  Finally, the prompt structure remained largely consistent throughout all revisions but improvements were made for clarity and efficiency.  The final version (12:28:46 PM) provides a detailed checklist to facilitate user review and confirmation before code generation.  A sample use case (`sample_usecase_codegen.prompt.md`) is included illustrating the entire process.


## 2:14:43 PM
The log shows iterative refinements to a prompt used for generating code, specifically a use case for fetching article details.  The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/domain/sample_usecase_codegen.prompt.md` file underwent numerous revisions between 1:56 PM and 2:13 PM on July 17, 2025.  These revisions primarily focused on the `Unit Test Details` section, changing the `Test Approach` from `MOCK_BASED` to `DI_BASED`.  Additionally, there were several edits removing and adding details about input parameters, dependencies, and return types.  The final version (2:13 PM) included API information from specified JSON and MD files for the `Get Article Detail` API. The file consistently pointed to a tech design document (`tech_design_diagram.md`) for reference.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/usecase/get_article_detail_use_case.dart` file was created and then modified multiple times between 2:05 PM and 2:08 PM on July 17, 2025. The main change within this file was a modification in exception handling within the `protectedExecute` method; the initial version threw `ValidationException` for invalid article IDs, later this was changed to a generic `Exception`. This suggests iterative refinement of error handling.


Finally, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/di/solution_domain_module.dart`  was updated between 1:58 PM and 1:59 PM on July 17, 2025.  This update appears to be a minor cleanup, removing the registration of `GetSolutionArticleDetailUseCase` from the dependency injection module. The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/di/solution_di_module.dart` was updated at 2:09 PM on July 17, 2025, registering various modules for testing purposes.


## 3:15:28 PM
The log shows a series of code changes and additions related to the "Solution" feature within a Flutter mobile application, likely Freshservice.  The changes span several days in July 2025.

Initially, a `solution_domain_module.dart` file is updated to register several use cases (`GetSolutionCategoriesUseCase`, `GetSolutionFoldersUseCase`, `GetSolutionSubfoldersAndArticlesUseCase`).  This suggests an existing solution feature undergoing expansion.

Subsequently, a significant update to a technical design document (`tech_design_diagram.md`) outlines the design for several screens: "Requester Solution Home," "Requester Popular Articles," and "Agent Article Detail." This document provides detailed UI mockups and diagrams (using Mermaid syntax) illustrating the domain and bloc architecture for each screen, defining various models like `ArticleModel`, `CategoryModel`, `SolutionHomeModel`, and `ArticleDetailModel`.

Multiple edits to `sample_usecase_codegen.prompt.md` indicate iterative refinement of prompts intended to generate code, specifically focusing on implementing the "Agent Article Detail" functionality.  The prompts consistently specify a technical design document as input and suggest using DI_BASED unit testing.

A `get_article_detail_use_case.dart` file is created and extensively modified.  The changes primarily revolve around input validation: initially, a `ValidationException` is thrown for invalid article IDs, which is then changed to an `ArgumentError`.  Finally, an `InvalidPageException` is used.  These changes reflect the evolution of error handling in the use case.

A JSON file (`success.json`) provides sample API response data for the "Get Article Detail" API endpoint.

The `solution_domain_module.dart` is updated again to include the newly created `GetArticleDetailUseCase`.

Multiple edits to `get_article_detail_use_case_test.dart` display the development of comprehensive unit tests for the `GetArticleDetailUseCase`.  These tests cover various scenarios, including successful retrieval of article details, error handling for invalid article IDs (initially with `ArgumentError`, then changed to `InvalidPageException`), and handling of repository errors.  The test assertions evolve over several commits to be more robust, particularly in the way it checks for exception messages.

Finally, the `solution_domain_module.dart` file is reverted to its original state before the addition of the `GetArticleDetailUseCase`, suggesting that the use case's registration has been moved elsewhere or is no longer needed.

The `usecase_test_guidelines.instructions.md` file provides detailed instructions on creating unit tests for use cases within the project. This document outlines file structures, naming conventions, best practices, and examples of test implementations.

In summary, the log highlights the development and testing of a new "Get Article Detail" use case for the solution feature.  There is evidence of iterative refinement in both the code and the tests, driven by a clear design documented in the technical design document. The final removal of the `GetArticleDetailUseCase` from the `solution_domain_module.dart` suggests a potential refactoring or a different approach to dependency injection.


## 4:14:45 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `get_article_detail_use_case.dart` file between 3:20 PM and 4:10 PM on July 17, 2025.  These revisions primarily focused on refining the input validation within the `GetArticleDetailUseCase` class. Initially, a `ValidationException` was thrown for invalid article IDs; this was later changed to an `ArgumentError`.  No functional changes were made to the core logic of the use case itself—it consistently fetches article details from a `SolutionRepository`. The minor repeated edits within this time frame likely represent quick saves or IDE auto-formatting.

Between 3:22 PM and 3:23 PM, the corresponding unit test file (`get_article_detail_use_case_test.dart`) was updated.  This update involved adding `SolutionDIModuleTest.register()` to the `setUp` function, suggesting a change in dependency injection setup.  The tests themselves remained largely consistent, covering successful retrieval, invalid article IDs (zero and negative), and repository error scenarios.

Later, between 4:04 PM and 4:05 PM, the `get_article_detail_expected_io.dart` file saw a brief, reverted change in the `success()` function. The `articleId` parameter was temporarily changed from 123 to 27000072285 then changed back to 123.

A more substantial update occurred around 4:10 PM, modifying `get_article_detail_use_case.dart` again. The exception type thrown for invalid input was changed from `ArgumentError` to a generic `Exception`. The code was also slightly refactored for improved readability. The `GetArticleDetailUseCaseParam` class was moved to be declared before the `GetArticleDetailUseCase` class.

Finally, around 4:11 PM, the `solution_domain_module.dart` file was updated to register the `GetArticleDetailUseCase`.  This is a standard dependency injection configuration, ensuring the use case is available for use in other parts of the application. The tests in  `get_article_detail_use_case_test.dart` were also updated at around 4:12PM, to reflect the change in exception type from `ArgumentError` to `Exception` and reducing the number of tests.  The test file now focused on three core scenarios: successful retrieval, handling of invalid article IDs (zero and negative), and a generic repository failure case. A helper file `get_article_detail_expected_io.dart` was updated to match the changes made in the `get_article_detail_use_case.dart` file.


The overall pattern shows iterative development, with multiple small adjustments to the use case and its test suite, culminating in a more robust and better-structured implementation. The use of a dedicated dependency injection module highlights a well-organized project structure.


## 5:14:46 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on implementing and testing a `GetArticleDetailUseCase` within the Freshservice Flutter mobile application's solution feature.

The initial changes on July 17th, 2025, at 4:14 PM involved creating a helper file (`get_article_detail_expected_io.dart`) containing sample input and output data for testing the use case. This file provides test scenarios for successful retrieval, and scenarios with invalid article IDs (negative and zero).

Subsequently, at 4:18 PM to 4:18:59 PM, multiple edits were made to  `usecase_test_guidelines.instructions.md`. These edits refined the guidelines for creating unit tests for use cases, specifically detailing file structure, naming conventions (emphasizing helper files with `_expected_io.dart` naming),  test implementation guidelines (including examples using mocking and dependency injection), and best practices (AAA pattern, test organization, and data management). The key change in these edits is the adjustment of the test file directory structure under `test/`. The location changed from  `test/usecase/`, `test/`,  `test/usecase/`  to `test/domain/usecase/` finally settling on  `test/domain/usecase/`.


At 4:19 PM, the `solution_domain_module.dart` file was updated to register the new `GetArticleDetailUseCase`.

Between 4:23 PM and 4:27 PM,  `sample_usecase_codegen.prompt.md` was edited twice. This file appears to be a prompt for a code generation tool, specifying details for generating the `GetArticleDetailUseCase`.  The content of the prompt remained largely the same across edits indicating that the parameters for code generation weren't adjusted.

Finally, between 4:25 PM and 4:29:35 PM,  `get_article_detail_use_case.dart` underwent several revisions. The core functionality remained consistent: fetching article details from a `SolutionRepository` after validating the input `articleId`. The primary change is a switch from using a generic `ValidationException` to a custom `InvalidArticleIdException` for handling invalid article IDs.

At 4:30 PM, `solution_domain_module.dart` was updated again to register the `GetArticleDetailUseCase`.

Lastly, at 4:30 PM and 4:31 PM, the `get_article_detail_expected_io.dart` file was updated to reflect the changes in the use case, changing the output type to `UCSuccessResult<SolutionArticleDetail>`. The `InvalidArticleIdException` class was also added at 4:33 PM, making it consistent with the use case.  The structure and content of the file remained identical between the two timestamps.

In summary, the code changes reflect an iterative process of implementing a new use case, refining testing guidelines, and adjusting related configuration files. The primary focus is on the creation and testing of the `GetArticleDetailUseCase`, with specific attention to exception handling and adherence to established testing best practices.


## 6:14:50 PM
The log shows a series of edits to a prompt file (`solution_agent_article_detail_model.prompt.md`) between 6:07 PM and 6:14 PM on July 17, 2025.  The prompt file is used to generate presentation layer models for an "Agent Article Detail" feature within a Flutter application.  The prompt consistently uses a `generic_presentation_layer_models_codegen.prompt` file as a template and specifies inputs such as the feature path (`features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail`), localization file, PRD document, and technical design diagram.

Initial versions of the prompt used `feature path`, while later versions switched to `feature name`. The `task specific notes` remained consistent, indicating that only the bloc model needs generation, as domain and data layers already exist.

Subsequently, three Dart files were created or updated at approximately 6:10 PM, 6:11 PM, and 6:13 PM:

*   **`article_detail_ui_state.dart`**: This file defines the UI state for the "Article Detail" screen using the `freezed` package.  It includes states for loading, content display (with details like article ID, title, content, author, attachments, etc.), and error handling. A nested `AttachmentUIModel` class is also defined.

*   **`article_detail_ui_event.dart`**: This file defines UI events for the "Article Detail" screen, including events for view creation, data refresh, attachment clicks, related article clicks, back button presses, navigation handling, and dialog closure.

*   **`article_detail_ui_state.freezed.dart`**: This is a generated file (indicated by the comment) providing boilerplate code for the `freezed` package's functionality with the `article_detail_ui_state.dart` file.  This includes code for equatable comparisons, copy methods, and other supporting functions.


The modifications to the prompt file suggest iterative refinement of the input parameters before the code generation occurred.  The final generated files (`article_detail_ui_state.dart`, `article_detail_ui_event.dart`, and `article_detail_ui_state.freezed.dart`) represent the core presentation logic for the Agent Article Detail feature.
