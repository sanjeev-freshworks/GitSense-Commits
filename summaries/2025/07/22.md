# Activity Summary for 7/22/2025

## 2:00:56 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/mapper/folder_detail_ui_mapper.dart` file and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` file between 7/21/2025, 9:17:27 PM and 7/21/2025, 9:47:25 PM.  The primary changes focus on the `SolutionFolderDetailUIMapper` class, which maps data models to UI models for displaying folder details.  Initially, the mapper handled `FolderItemModelFolder`, `FolderItemModelArticle`, and `FolderItemModelExternalArticle` types.  Subsequent changes added additional fields (`modifiedAt`, `views`, `authorName`, `status`) to the `ArticleUiModel`,  handling potential null values and converting `modifiedAt` to ISO8601 format and `views` to an integer.  A `getStatusName` helper function was added to determine the article status label, initially hardcoded, later using `SolutionLibLocalizations` for localization.  Finally, the `_mapItemToUiModel` function was refactored to use a `switch` statement for improved readability and maintainability. The file was also renamed from `SolutionFolderDetailUIMapper` to `FolderDetailUIMapper`.

Simultaneously, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` file was updated to include new localized strings for "draft" and "views". These changes aim at improving the localization support within the application.

The `FolderDetailBloc` file also underwent significant changes, primarily involving the refactoring of event and state names to be consistent with other parts of the application. There was no functional change observed.  The  `getNextPage` function was added to handle pagination logic more efficiently.

The `FolderDetailContent` file saw modifications where the class name was changed from `SolutionFolderDetailContent` to `FolderDetailContent` and event handlers updated for consistency.  The code added an `FSEventHandler` import for type safety.


The overall pattern in the changes reflects a consistent effort towards improving code quality, adding features, and enhancing the user experience by localizing strings and improving the mapping logic between data and UI models.  The consistent renaming of classes and functions across the files indicates a larger refactoring effort within the application.
