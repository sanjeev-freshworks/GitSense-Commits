# Activity Summary for 7/11/2025

## 2:08:59 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/solution_folders/presentation/bloc/solution_folders_list_bloc.dart` file between 1:53 PM and 2:06 PM on July 11, 2025.  These changes center around refining a Flutter Bloc for managing a list of solution folders.

Initially, the `solution_folders_list_bloc.dart` file was incomplete, with placeholder comments indicating unimplemented event-to-state mapping.  Through several iterations, the bloc was progressively fleshed out.  The most significant changes involved:


* **Type adjustments:**  The Bloc's generic types (`SolutionFoldersListEvent`, `SolutionFoldersListState`) underwent multiple revisions, eventually settling on `FolderListEvent` and `FolderListState`. This suggests a refactoring effort to improve consistency or clarity.

* **Dependency injection:** The bloc was modified to incorporate dependency injection, taking `GetSolutionFoldersUseCase`, `FolderUiModelMapper`, and `FolderListScreenArgs` in the constructor. This is a good practice for testing and maintainability.

* **Event handling:**  Event handlers (`_onViewCreated`, `_onLoadFolders`, `_onNavigationHandled`, `_onItemClick`) were added to handle different events related to viewing, loading, navigation, and item selection within the solution folder list.

* **Data fetching and handling:** The `_onLoadFolders` event handler now fetches solution folder data using a `GetSolutionFoldersUseCase`, handles success and error cases (`UCSuccessResult`, `UCErrorResult`), and updates the bloc state accordingly using pagination (`FSPagingState`).  The handling of initial page loading was also adjusted.


* **Use Case Refinement:** The `GetSolutionFoldersUseCase` was modified to accept a `GetSolutionFoldersUseCaseParam` instead of  `SolutionFoldersQuery`, making the parameter passing more explicit.  The `protectedExecute` method was updated to correctly use the new parameter type.

* **Mapper Implementation:** The bloc utilizes a `FolderUiModelMapper` to transform data models into UI models, improving separation of concerns.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/pubspec.lock` file shows a snapshot of the project's dependencies at 1:14:55 PM on July 11, 2025. This file is not directly related to the functional changes observed in the bloc but provides context regarding the project's libraries and packages.  The updates in `solution_folders_list_bloc.dart` likely rely on many of these libraries for functionality.

The test file (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/domain/helper/get_solution_folders_expected_io.dart`) shows setup for testing the `GetSolutionFoldersUseCase` at 2:03:11 PM.  This further supports the idea that significant refactoring and development occurred in the `solution` feature around this time.


## 3:08:54 PM
The log shows a single update to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/solution_folders/presentation/bloc/solution_folders_list_bloc.dart` on July 11, 2025, at 2:35:00 PM.  This file contains a Flutter Bloc for managing a list of solution folders.  The Bloc handles events related to view creation (`FolderListEventViewCreated`), loading folders (`FolderListEventLoadFolders`), navigation (`FolderListEventNavigationHandled`), and item clicks (`FolderListEventItemClick`).

The `_onLoadFolders` function fetches solution folders using a `GetSolutionFoldersUseCase`, maps them to UI models using `_solutionFolderUiModelMapper`, and updates the Bloc state with paging information.  Error handling is included, and success updates the state with the fetched folders.  The `_onItemClick` function is currently a stub, indicating future implementation for handling folder item clicks.  The code uses pagination (`FSPagingState`) to handle loading folders in batches.  A placeholder comment suggests the addition of presentation constants in the future.  The code imports several packages including `flutter_bloc`, `common_business`, `common_ui`, and `core`.


## 4:08:55 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/solution_folders/presentation/bloc/solution_folders_list_bloc.dart` file between 3:47 PM and 3:48 PM on July 11, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout all revisions: a Flutter Bloc managing a list of solution folders.  The bloc handles events related to view creation (`FolderListEventViewCreated`), loading folders (`FolderListEventLoadFolders`), navigation handling (`FolderListEventNavigationHandled`), and item clicks.

The primary changes across revisions center around the event handler for item clicks (`_onItemClick`).  Initially, the event was named `FolderListEventIt`, then `FolderListEventItem`, then `FolderListEventItemClic`, and finally settled on `FolderListEventFolderClicked`.  This suggests iterative refinement of the event naming.  The commented-out code within `_onItemClick` consistently hints at a future implementation for handling folder navigation to articles within that folder.

There are no functional changes to the folder loading and error handling within the `_onLoadFolders`, `loadFoldersSuccess`, and `loadFoldersError` functions across the revisions.  The code structure and logic for pagination using `FSPagingState` also remain unchanged.  The minor formatting change in `_onViewCreated` removing extra space around `pagingState` in the last revision is insignificant functionally.  All revisions use the same imports and class structure.
