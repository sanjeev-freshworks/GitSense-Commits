# Activity Summary for 7/25/2025

## 8:39:11 AM
The log shows two edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/test/usecase/helper/get_related_articles_expected_io.dart`.  Both edits modify the `success()` function within the `GetRelatedArticlesExpectedIo` class.

The first edit (7/25/2025, 8:37:58 AM) sets the `limit` parameter in `GetRelatedArticlesUseCaseParam` to `5`. The second edit (7/25/2025, 8:38:24 AM), made only a minute later, changes this `limit` parameter to `10`.  The rest of the file, including the `successWithoutLimit()`, `successWithZeroLimit()`, and `successWithNegativeLimit()` functions, remains unchanged across both edits.  The changes consistently use the same article ID (29000038981) and  `RelatedArticle` data. The pattern shows testing different limit values for retrieving related articles.


## 9:39:10 AM
The log shows two edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/src/ui/solution_folder/view/component/content/folder_list_item.dart`.  Both edits occurred on July 25, 2025, within a minute of each other (9:19:39 AM and 9:19:53 AM).  The changes are minor, focusing on the `Container` widget's `margin` property within the `FolderListItem` widget. The first version uses separate `EdgeInsets` values for left, right, top, and bottom margins, while the second version simplifies this to a single `EdgeInsets.symmetric` call for horizontal and vertical margins.  The core functionality of the `FolderListItem` (displaying folder name and metadata) remains unchanged.  The changes suggest a minor refactoring for improved code readability and potentially better maintainability.
