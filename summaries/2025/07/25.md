# Activity Summary for 7/25/2025

## 8:39:11 AM
The log shows two edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/test/usecase/helper/get_related_articles_expected_io.dart`.  Both edits modify the `success()` function within the `GetRelatedArticlesExpectedIo` class.

The first edit (7/25/2025, 8:37:58 AM) sets the `limit` parameter in `GetRelatedArticlesUseCaseParam` to `5`. The second edit (7/25/2025, 8:38:24 AM), made only a minute later, changes this `limit` parameter to `10`.  The rest of the file, including the `successWithoutLimit()`, `successWithZeroLimit()`, and `successWithNegativeLimit()` functions, remains unchanged across both edits.  The changes consistently use the same article ID (29000038981) and  `RelatedArticle` data. The pattern shows testing different limit values for retrieving related articles.


## 9:39:10 AM
The log shows two edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/src/ui/solution_folder/view/component/content/folder_list_item.dart`.  Both edits occurred on July 25, 2025, within a minute of each other (9:19:39 AM and 9:19:53 AM).  The changes are minor, focusing on the `Container` widget's `margin` property within the `FolderListItem` widget. The first version uses separate `EdgeInsets` values for left, right, top, and bottom margins, while the second version simplifies this to a single `EdgeInsets.symmetric` call for horizontal and vertical margins.  The core functionality of the `FolderListItem` (displaying folder name and metadata) remains unchanged.  The changes suggest a minor refactoring for improved code readability and potentially better maintainability.


## 9:39:16 AM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal` directory, specifically within the `test` and `lib` subdirectories.  The changes span approximately one hour (8:52 AM to 9:34 AM).

The most significant changes involve the `get_related_articles_expected_io.dart` and `related_article_fixture.dart` files within the test directory.  These files were modified multiple times between 8:52 AM and 9:00 AM, refining the test fixtures for handling different limit parameters (including `null`, `0`, and negative values) in the `GetRelatedArticlesUseCase`.  The initial versions manually created `RelatedArticle` instances; later versions utilized the `RelatedArticleFixture` class for generating sample data, improving code maintainability.  Around 9:00 AM, the `success` method in `get_related_articles_expected_io.dart` was simplified to handle various articleIds and limits with a single function.  Finally, at 9:03 AM, the `RelatedArticleFixture.generate()` function was updated to return a default `RelatedArticle` if the generation logic failed.


The `related_article_fixture.dart` file saw substantial changes between 8:55 AM and 8:58 AM. Initially, it contained multiple sample `RelatedArticle` instances. This was later simplified, ultimately only generating a single instance, then later modified to be an empty list and finally, to generate only one  `RelatedArticle` instance.

Concurrently, changes occurred in the `/lib/src` directory.  Between 9:12 AM and 9:34 AM,  modifications were made to the `get_related_articles_use_case.dart`, `solution_support_portal_repository_v2.dart`, `solution_support_portal_repository_v2_impl.dart`, and `get_related_article_api_model_mapper.dart` files. These changes focused on refining the `GetRelatedArticlesUseCase` to handle various scenarios and properly map API responses to the `ArticleItemModel`. Specifically, the return type of `protectedExecute` in `get_related_articles_use_case.dart` was changed from `List<RelatedArticle>` to `List<ArticleItemModel>`, reflecting a change in data model.  The `get_related_article_api_model_mapper.dart` file underwent several iterations to correctly handle the mapping of API responses to different subtypes of `ArticleItemModel` based on the presence or absence of `externalUrl`. The final version uses `ArticleItemModel.articleModel` and `ArticleItemModel.externalArticleModel` for improved clarity and maintainability. The `get_related_articles_use_case_test.dart` file was updated at 9:01 AM to reflect these changes in data model and to utilize the simplified `GetRelatedArticlesExpectedIo.success` method.  At 9:03 AM,  `RelatedArticleFixture.generate()` in `related_article_fixture.dart` was altered to return an empty list, and subsequently corrected.  The `get_related_articles_expected_io.dart` file was adjusted at 9:03 AM and 9:04 AM to provide a default `RelatedArticle` instance within the `success` method.  A final adjustment at 9:04 AM removed the dependency on `RelatedArticleFixture` entirely within `get_related_articles_expected_io.dart`.


In summary, the code changes demonstrate a focused effort on testing and refining the `GetRelatedArticlesUseCase`, along with associated data models and mapping logic.  The initial testing phase was improved through the use of a fixture class. The changes ensure proper handling of limit parameters and a consistent data model throughout the application.


## 10:39:12 AM
The log shows modifications to a JSON file (`success.json`) containing mock API responses for related articles, and a Dart file (`get_related_articles_expected_io.dart`) containing test data.

The `success.json` file underwent several revisions between 9:49 AM and 9:53 AM on July 25, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on refining the title and adding an `external_url` to the second article (id 29000038982). The title evolved from "Employee Code of Conduct (Sample)" and "Agile" to "Code of Conduct for Employees - A Handbook", and the `external_url` was eventually finalized as "https://www.example.com/employee-code-of-conduct".  Additionally, the description for article with id 29000038982 was removed at the end.


The `get_related_articles_expected_io.dart` file was updated at 9:56 AM on July 25, 2025.  This Dart code appears to define expected input and output for a unit test related to fetching related articles. The test data reflects the final state of the `success.json` file, including the corrected title and the external URL for the second article.  The code uses  `ArticleItemModel` to represent articles.  It specifically includes  `ArticleItemModel.articleModel` and `ArticleItemModel.externalArticleModel` to distinguish between internal and external articles.
