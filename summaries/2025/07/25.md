# Activity Summary for 7/25/2025

## 8:39:11 AM
The log shows two edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/test/usecase/helper/get_related_articles_expected_io.dart`.  Both edits modify the `success()` function within the `GetRelatedArticlesExpectedIo` class.

The first edit (7/25/2025, 8:37:58 AM) sets the `limit` parameter in `GetRelatedArticlesUseCaseParam` to `5`. The second edit (7/25/2025, 8:38:24 AM), made only a minute later, changes this `limit` parameter to `10`.  The rest of the file, including the `successWithoutLimit()`, `successWithZeroLimit()`, and `successWithNegativeLimit()` functions, remains unchanged across both edits.  The changes consistently use the same article ID (29000038981) and  `RelatedArticle` data. The pattern shows testing different limit values for retrieving related articles.


## 9:39:10 AM
The log shows two edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/src/ui/solution_folder/view/component/content/folder_list_item.dart`.  Both edits occurred on July 25, 2025, within a minute of each other (9:19:39 AM and 9:19:53 AM).  The changes are minor, focusing on the `Container` widget's `margin` property within the `FolderListItem` widget. The first version uses separate `EdgeInsets` values for left, right, top, and bottom margins, while the second version simplifies this to a single `EdgeInsets.symmetric` call for horizontal and vertical margins.  The core functionality of the `FolderListItem` (displaying folder name and metadata) remains unchanged.  The changes suggest a minor refactoring for improved code readability and potentially better maintainability.


## 9:39:16 AM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal` directory, specifically within the `test` and `lib` subdirectories.  The changes span approximately one hour (8:52 AM to 9:34 AM).

The most significant changes involve the `get_related_articles_expected_io.dart` and `related_article_fixture.dart` files within the test directory.  These files were modified multiple times between 8:52 AM and 9:00 AM, refining the test fixtures for handling different limit parameters (including `null`, `0`, and negative values) in the `GetRelatedArticlesUseCase`.  The initial versions manually created `RelatedArticle` instances; later versions utilized the `RelatedArticleFixture` class for generating sample data, improving code maintainability.  Around 9:00 AM, the `success` method in `get_related_articles_expected_io.dart` was simplified to handle various articleIds and limits with a single function.  Finally, at 9:03 AM, the `RelatedArticleFixture.generate()` function was updated to return a default `RelatedArticle` if the generation logic failed.


The `related_article_fixture.dart` file saw substantial changes between 8:55 AM and 8:58 AM. Initially, it contained multiple sample `RelatedArticle` instances. This was later simplified, ultimately only generating a single instance, then later modified to be an empty list and finally, to generate only one  `RelatedArticle` instance.

Concurrently, changes occurred in the `/lib/src` directory.  Between 9:12 AM and 9:34 AM,  modifications were made to the `get_related_articles_use_case.dart`, `solution_support_portal_repository_v2.dart`, `solution_support_portal_repository_v2_impl.dart`, and `get_related_article_api_model_mapper.dart` files. These changes focused on refining the `GetRelatedArticlesUseCase` to handle various scenarios and properly map API responses to the `ArticleItemModel`. Specifically, the return type of `protectedExecute` in `get_related_articles_use_case.dart` was changed from `List<RelatedArticle>` to `List<ArticleItemModel>`, reflecting a change in data model.  The `get_related_article_api_model_mapper.dart` file underwent several iterations to correctly handle the mapping of API responses to different subtypes of `ArticleItemModel` based on the presence or absence of `externalUrl`. The final version uses `ArticleItemModel.articleModel` and `ArticleItemModel.externalArticleModel` for improved clarity and maintainability. The `get_related_articles_use_case_test.dart` file was updated at 9:01 AM to reflect these changes in data model and to utilize the simplified `GetRelatedArticlesExpectedIo.success` method.  At 9:03 AM,  `RelatedArticleFixture.generate()` in `related_article_fixture.dart` was altered to return an empty list, and subsequently corrected.  The `get_related_articles_expected_io.dart` file was adjusted at 9:03 AM and 9:04 AM to provide a default `RelatedArticle` instance within the `success` method.  A final adjustment at 9:04 AM removed the dependency on `RelatedArticleFixture` entirely within `get_related_articles_expected_io.dart`.


In summary, the code changes demonstrate a focused effort on testing and refining the `GetRelatedArticlesUseCase`, along with associated data models and mapping logic.  The initial testing phase was improved through the use of a fixture class. The changes ensure proper handling of limit parameters and a consistent data model throughout the application.


## 10:39:12 AM
The log shows modifications to a JSON file (`success.json`) containing mock API responses for related articles, and a Dart file (`get_related_articles_expected_io.dart`) containing test data.

The `success.json` file underwent several revisions between 9:49 AM and 9:53 AM on July 25, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on refining the title and adding an `external_url` to the second article (id 29000038982). The title evolved from "Employee Code of Conduct (Sample)" and "Agile" to "Code of Conduct for Employees - A Handbook", and the `external_url` was eventually finalized as "https://www.example.com/employee-code-of-conduct".  Additionally, the description for article with id 29000038982 was removed at the end.


The `get_related_articles_expected_io.dart` file was updated at 9:56 AM on July 25, 2025.  This Dart code appears to define expected input and output for a unit test related to fetching related articles. The test data reflects the final state of the `success.json` file, including the corrected title and the external URL for the second article.  The code uses  `ArticleItemModel` to represent articles.  It specifically includes  `ArticleItemModel.articleModel` and `ArticleItemModel.externalArticleModel` to distinguish between internal and external articles.


## 11:39:13 AM
The code changes log shows updates primarily focused on the Freshservice mobile application's solution portal.  The most significant changes occurred between 11:24 AM and 11:26 AM on July 25th, 2025.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/solution_v2/get_related_article_list_api_model_mapper.dart` (10:51:11 AM): This file contains Dart code defining mappers to convert API responses (`RelatedArticleApiModel`) into the application's data model (`ArticleItemModel`).  The mappers handle both internal and external articles, checking for `externalUrl` before choosing the appropriate model constructor.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/domain/usecase/solution_v2/get_related_articles_use_case.dart` (11:00:11 AM): This Dart file implements a use case for fetching related articles.  It processes a limit parameter (handling 0 or negative values), creates a query object, calls a repository (`SolutionSupportPortalRepositoryV2`) to retrieve the articles, and returns a list of `ArticleItemModel`.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/solution/get_folder_info/success.json` (11:16:18 AM): This JSON file provides a sample successful response for a "Get Folder Info" API call. It includes data like folder ID, name, description, timestamps, and parent ID.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/solution/solution.md` (Multiple timestamps between 11:24 AM and 11:26 AM): This Markdown file documents various Solution APIs.  The file underwent multiple edits within a short timeframe, primarily refining the documentation for the "Get Folder Info" API. Initially, it lacked a definition for this API.  The edits added a description, clarified the use of `folderId` as a path parameter, and added a successful response example.  The changes show an iterative process of improving documentation.

In summary, the log illustrates development work involving data mapping, use case implementation, mock API responses, and API documentation, all centered around the solution portal feature of the Freshservice mobile application. The final series of commits clearly shows a rapid iteration on the documentation for the `Get Folder Info` API endpoint.


## 12:39:14 PM
The log shows a series of code changes across several files within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory, focusing on the implementation of a folder list UI.  The changes span from approximately 11:49 AM to 12:00 PM on July 25, 2025.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_list/view/folder_list_content.dart`: This file underwent two revisions. The primary change between the versions was the addition of `firstPageProgressIndicatorBuilder` and `newPageProgressIndicatorBuilder` in the second version, providing visual feedback during pagination.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_list/presentation/model/folder_list_state.dart`: This file introduces a `FolderListState` class using the `freezed` package, defining states like `loading` and `content` to manage the UI state of the folder list.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_list/view/folder_list_screen_root.dart`: This file had several revisions. Early versions implemented a basic UI with an AppBar and a body based on the `FolderListState`.  Later versions added a loading state (`FolderListStateLoading`) to display a `Container` while data loads, and most significantly, added logging using `FSLogger` within the `_buildBody` function to log "Loading folder list" during the loading state around 12:00:22 PM.  The `go_router` import was also removed in later revisions.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_list/presentation/bloc/folder_list_bloc.dart`: This file, containing the BLoC for managing the folder list, experienced multiple changes.  A crucial modification was the change in the initial state of `FolderListBloc` from `super()` to `super(const FolderListState.content(pagingState: FSPagingState()))` and then finally to `super(const Container())`.  The bloc handles events for loading folders, handling navigation, and updating the UI accordingly, using `GetSolutionFoldersUseCase` and `FolderUiModelMapper`.  The code consistently utilizes the `FSPagingState` for pagination management.

Recurring elements throughout the code include consistent use of the `solution_lib`, `common_ui`, `core_ui`, and `core` packages, indicating a well-structured project with shared UI components and core functionalities.  The use of BLoC pattern and freezed demonstrates a structured approach to state management and UI updates. The use of `FSLogger` for logging suggests a focus on debugging and monitoring within the application.


## 1:39:22 PM
The provided log shows multiple revisions of a Flutter Bloc (`folder_list_bloc.dart`) and its corresponding unit tests (`folder_list_bloc_test.dart`).  The `folder_list_bloc.dart` file manages the presentation logic for a folder list, likely within a solution-related feature of a Freshservice mobile application.  No significant changes were made to the imports or class structure across revisions.

The most substantial changes occur within the `_onLoadFolders` function, handling the loading of folders.  There are several revisions between 12:57 PM and 1:03 PM, with no apparent changes to functionality. A final change to the `_calculateNextPageKey` function, with some minor additions, happened at 1:32 PM.

The unit tests extensively cover various scenarios related to folder loading.  These include successful loading with different metadata conditions (e.g., presence/absence of metadata, zero count, invalid `perPage`), empty results, and error handling. The tests use Mockito for mocking dependencies and BlocTest for testing Bloc behavior.  A notable change at 1:37 PM in the unit tests introduces more `const` usage, improving code clarity and potentially enabling compiler optimizations.  Further changes around 1:38 PM simplified some test setup, using `const` constructors for `SolutionFolders` and `UCResult`. A final update at 1:38 PM added a test case for an invalid page number (page 0).


## 2:39:18 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `solution` feature within a Flutter mobile application.  The activity centers around a `FolderListBloc` and its associated unit tests.  Significant changes occurred between 1:39 PM and 2:01 PM on July 25th, 2025.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_list/presentation/bloc/folder_list_bloc.dart`  (1:39:43 PM): This file contains the implementation of the `FolderListBloc`, which manages the UI for a list of solution folders. The bloc handles events such as `FolderListEventViewCreated`, `FolderListEventFolderClicked`, `FolderListEventNavigationHandled`, and `FolderListEventLoadFolders`.  It uses pagination (`FSPagingState`) to fetch and display folder data,  handles success and error cases from a `GetSolutionFoldersUseCase`, and maps data using a `FolderUiModelMapper`.  The code includes detailed error handling and logging using `FSLogger`.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/ui/bloc/folder_list_bloc_test.dart` (1:39:56 PM, 1:40:17 PM, 1:40:35 PM, 1:40:45 PM, 1:41:12 PM): This file contains unit tests for the `FolderListBloc`. The tests extensively cover the `FolderListEventLoadFolders` event, testing various scenarios including successful folder loading with different pagination metadata (including edge cases like zero count and invalid `perPage` values),  handling of empty results, and pagination with page numbers greater than 1.  Mocking is used for dependencies (`GetSolutionFoldersUseCase` and `FolderUiModelMapper`). There were multiple revisions of this file during a short timeframe suggesting iterative development and debugging of the tests.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md` (1:52:29 PM - 2:28:29 PM):  This file shows a series of prompts for a code generation tool (`data_layer_codegen`). These prompts aim to generate data layer code (data sources, repositories, and mappers) for fetching "Get Folder Info" from a specified API endpoint. The input parameters of the prompts are refined across multiple edits, involving adjustments to the module name,  API information source, query and path parameters, handling of enums (visibility field), and file naming conventions.  The final iteration specifies  'visibility' enum values representing different user access levels.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/solution/get_folder_info/success.json` (2:22:27 PM): This JSON file likely represents a sample API response used to inform the code generation process shown above in the prompts.  It describes a folder object containing fields like `id`, `name`, `description`, `visibility`, `category_name`, etc.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/folder_info_api_model.dart` (2:24:13 PM - 2:24:37 PM): This file is a data model representing the folder information received from the API.  Multiple revisions suggest attempts to define the model's structure, ultimately leading to an incomplete declaration.


In summary, the majority of the activity is focused on implementing and testing the folder list functionality.  The later prompts and API response data suggest a parallel effort to generate the data layer code automatically based on the API specification.  There is clear evidence of iterative development and debugging across both the BLoC implementation and unit testing.


## 3:39:17 PM
The log shows code changes across several files between 2:53 PM and 3:38 PM on July 25, 2025.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md` file was updated at 2:53:22 PM. This file contains a prompt to generate Dart code for a data layer, specifically for a "Get Folder Info" feature within a "solution" module.  The code generation uses API information from a mock API (`freshservice_mobile_api_mock`),  specifying path parameters, enums, and data handling rules.  The prompt outlines the naming conventions for generated files (e.g., `solution_remote_constants.dart`, `solution_repository.dart`).

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/solution/get_folder_info/success.json` file underwent multiple revisions between 2:53:43 PM and 3:17:02 PM.  These revisions involved modifications to the `visibility` field within the JSON response, reflecting changes in folder access permissions. Initially, the folder was visible to logged-in users (`visibility`: 2) and later updated to be visible to specific departments (`visibility`: 4).  A final revision reverted the visibility to `visibility`: 2. An additional comment "Visible to: HR, IT" was added at 2:55:56 PM and later removed.

The `/Users/skumar14/.zshrc` file was updated twice, at 3:13:41 PM and 3:16:30 PM. These changes added environment variables setting paths for Android SDK, NDK, Go, Protocol buffers, and Flutter.  Also,  `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_LOCATION`, `RELEASE_STORE_PASS`, `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`, and `RELEASE_KEY_PASS` variables were added. The content of these variables are redacted as they are likely to contain sensitive information. The changes do not indicate functional alterations within the ZSH configuration itself, just the addition of new environment variables.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/user_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/bootstrap_account_api_model.dart` file was updated several times between 3:21:42 PM and 3:22:20 PM. These modifications involved adding a `name` field to the `WorkSpaceApiModel` class.  These are minor changes related to data model structure.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/helper/util/pagination_util.dart` file was extensively modified between 3:31:06 PM and 3:38:26 PM.  The core functionality of the `_calculateNextPageKey` function was refactored into a function called `calculateNextPageKey`. This function was initially dependent on a `SolutionFoldersMeta` object for pagination information.  The function's logic was revised to instead use `perPageCount` and `totalCount` parameters and logging with `FSLogger` was added. The function signature also changed multiple times, evolving from accepting various combinations of parameters to finally using named parameters with `required` keywords for better code clarity and maintainability.  The documentation comments were significantly improved and clarified.  The final version of the code efficiently calculates the next page key based on the provided per-page count and total count, handling various edge cases and logging relevant information.


## 7:51:39 PM
The log shows code changes across several files within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory, primarily focused on the `article_detail` feature.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/di/solution_ui_module.dart`**:  This file underwent two identical updates on 7/25/2025, 5:46:32 PM and 5:46:40 PM.  The changes register different BLoCs (`CategoryListBloc`, `FolderListBloc`, `ArticleDetailBloc`) and a `FolderUiModelMapper` using dependency injection (`fsDIComponent`). No actual code changes occurred between the two timestamps.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/presentation/bloc/article_detail_bloc.dart`**: This file contains a significant number of updates between 7/25/2025, 5:46:52 PM and 7/25/2025, 7:46:59 PM.  The evolution of this BLoC is notable. Initially, a basic BLoC structure is defined.  Later changes introduce event handling (`registerEvents`), state management (`contentState`), and the integration of a `GetSolutionArticleDetailUseCase`.  The use case is updated to accept parameters.  Finally, a switch statement is added to handle success and error cases from the use case, using `UCSuccessResult` and `UCErrorResult`. The bloc also now handles different events related to language selection and article info display.  Error handling is improved and the bloc is made to accept `ArticleDetailScreenArgs` as a constructor parameter.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/presentation/mapper/article_detail_ui_mapper.dart`**: This mapper initially started as an empty `BaseMapper`. It went through several iterations, adding and refining an `ArticleDetailUiMapperInput` class.  The final version implements the `map` function to convert `SolutionArticleDetail` to `ArticleDetailUiModel` (7/25/2025, 5:50:43 PM onwards).

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/article_detail_api_model.dart`**: This file shows the gradual addition of fields to the `ArticleDetailApiModel` class, starting from an empty class and progressively adding fields like `id`, `title`, `description`, `createdAt`, `modifiedAt`, `modifiedBy`, `folderName`, `categoryName`, `language`, `author`, `workspaceId`, `views`, `thumbsUp`, `thumbsDown`, and `attachements` and `cloudAttachments`.  The `freezed_annotation` library is used. A new `ArticleLanguageApiModel` class is also added towards the end.  These changes happened between 7/25/2025, 5:57:01 PM and 7/25/2025, 6:09:19 PM.


**Overall Pattern**: The changes follow a pattern of iterative development.  The `article_detail` feature is being fleshed out with increased functionality, including language support and improved error handling.  The use of BLoCs, dependency injection, and mappers suggests a structured approach to building the application. The use of `freezed_annotation` indicates a preference for immutable data models.  The final `article_detail_bloc` is a well-structured bloc that handles various events and updates the state accordingly.  There's a clear progression from a simple BLoC to one with comprehensive event handling and state management.  The API model (`ArticleDetailApiModel`) is also refined over several commits to include all necessary fields.


## 8:51:25 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to several files within the `mobile_flutter_freshservice` project's `solution` feature.  The primary focus is on the `article_detail_bloc.dart` and `folder_detail_screen.dart` files.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/presentation/bloc/article_detail_bloc.dart` underwent several revisions between 7:54 PM and 7:59 PM on July 25, 2025.  These changes primarily involved the `_onLanguageSelected` function within the `ArticleDetailBloc` class.  Initially, this function contained commented-out code and incomplete implementation for handling language selection.  The final revision left the language selection logic as a `TODO` comment.  The `_onViewCreated` function consistently contains `TODO` comments related to UI mapping.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/presentation/model/article_detail_event.dart` was updated at 7:54:47 PM on July 25, 2025. This update appears to be the definition of events using the `freezed` package for the article detail feature.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_list/presentation/bloc/folder_list_bloc.dart` was updated at 8:06:21 PM on July 25, 2025. This file shows the implementation of a BLoC for handling folder list functionalities, including loading folders, handling pagination, and navigation to folder details.  It uses a `FolderUiModelMapper` and handles success and error cases during folder loading.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/folder_detail_screen.dart` was modified multiple times between 8:42 PM and 8:49 PM on July 25, 2025. The key change involved implementing the `_listenState` function to handle navigation based on different states (`FolderDetailNavigationState`).  Initially, some navigation cases were marked as `TODO`, but later revisions implemented the navigation to external URLs using the `url_launcher` package.  Error handling was also improved in the final version, addressing potential null values in the external URL.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/pubspec.yaml` was updated at 8:46:33 PM on July 25, 2025. This update reflects the project's dependencies, showing the use of several packages including `flutter_bloc`, `freezed`, `go_router`, and others common in Flutter development.


The overall pattern shows iterative development, with several small changes refining the Bloc implementation and navigation handling within the solution feature of the application.  The frequent updates to `folder_detail_screen.dart` suggest focused effort on improving the navigation and user experience of this particular screen.  The consistent use of BLoC pattern and several common Flutter packages is also evident throughout the code changes.


## 9:51:37 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/testfixture/data/solution_subfolders_and_articles_fixture.dart` file between 7/25/2025, 9:01:58 PM and 7/25/2025, 9:03:54 PM.  These changes appear to be minor and inconsequential, likely related to formatting or refactoring, as the code remains substantially the same across these revisions.  A more significant change to this file occurs at 9:03:54 PM where the import statement `import 'package:solution/test/testfixture/data/folder_item_model_fixture.dart';` is modified to `import 'folder_item_model_fixture.dart';`. This suggests a relative import path adjustment.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/ui/bloc/folder_detail_bloc_test.dart` file undergoes several revisions between 7/25/2025, 9:03:04 PM and 7/25/2025, 9:17:41 PM.  These changes are more substantial and primarily involve enhancements to the unit test cases within the `folder_detail_bloc_test.dart` file. Specifically, the tests for `LoadItems` event are significantly expanded to cover various scenarios including initial page success, subsequent page success, last page success, error handling, and empty result sets.  The handling of  `UCResult`  changes from  `UCSuccessResult` and `UCErrorResult` to `UCResult.success` and `UCResult.error` indicating a refactoring of the result handling. The  `expect`  statements in the `ArticleItemClicked`, `FolderItemClicked`, and `ExternalArticleItemClicked` events are modified to use  `predicate<FolderDetailState>`  for more robust assertion checking.  The import statement `import '../../testfixture/ui/folder_detail/solution_lib_localizations_fixture.dart';` is added and later removed in multiple revisions, showing some experimentation with localization.  Finally, the import `import 'package:solution/src/data/model/response/solution_subfolders_and_articles.dart';` is added, removed, and added back, potentially indicating some refactoring of dependencies.

Other files show additions of UI models: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/model/article_ui_model.dart` and  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/model/external_article_ui_model.dart`  are created at 9:17:51 PM and 9:18:41 PM respectively, using `freezed` for data class generation. Corresponding test fixture files are also created for these UI models.

The changes demonstrate a focused effort on improving the robustness and coverage of the unit tests for the `FolderDetailBloc` and refining the UI models and mapper.  The numerous small edits in `solution_subfolders_and_articles_fixture.dart` might indicate iterative development and debugging of the test fixtures.
