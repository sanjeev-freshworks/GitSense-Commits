# Activity Summary for 7/1/2025

## 10:40:37 AM
The log shows modifications to two files within a Flutter project on July 1st, 2025.

The `/melos.yaml` file (10:03:02 AM) details the project's build configuration using Melos.  It defines various scripts for tasks such as running analysis, formatting code, building, testing (unit and widget tests, with coverage and exclusion options for specific files/folders like auto-generated files, UI components, and test libraries), and managing internationalization (l10n) and Pigeon code generation. The file specifies Flutter SDK version 3.7.2 and Flutter version 3.29.2, and lists numerous dependencies including packages for state management (Flutter Bloc, Provider, GetIt, Rxdart, Freezed), UI (Cupertino Icons, Flutter SVG, Lottie, Shimmer, Infinite Scroll Pagination), networking (HTTP), file handling (File Picker, Image Picker), routing (Go Router), and testing (Flutter Test, Mockito, Bloc Test).

The `/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/pubspec.yaml` file (10:03:12 AM) is a pubspec file defining dependencies for a specific UI library (`common_ui`). It also uses Flutter SDK version 3.7.2 and Flutter version 3.29.2 and lists dependencies mirroring a subset of those in `melos.yaml`, specifically focusing on UI and state management tools.  It also includes references to other internal packages ( `core`, `core_ui`, `common_base`, `common_business`, `user_lib`), indicating a modular project structure.  The version of this library is listed as 0.0.1.  Assets are declared from `/assets/images/` and `/assets/raw/` folders.

In summary, the changes reflect updates to a large Flutter project's build configuration and a library's dependency list, both occurring within a minute of each other, suggesting a coordinated update. The use of Melos indicates a multi-package project.  The extensive testing scripts suggest a focus on thorough testing and coverage.


## 4:41:03 PM
The log shows modifications to documentation and response files related to Freshservice's solution API.  The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/solution/solution.md` file underwent numerous revisions between 3:54 PM and 4:32 PM on July 1st, 2025.  These revisions primarily focused on refining the API documentation, specifically the descriptions for retrieving folders and subfolders with articles. Initially, the documentation included sections for "Get Categories," "Get Search Solutions," and "Get Solution Article Detail," but these were eventually removed, leaving only "Get Folders" and "Get Subfolders and Articles."

The API endpoint for retrieving folders changed from `/support/v2/solutions/:category_id` to `/api/_/solutions/folders`, and query parameters like `category_id`, `page`, and `per_page` were added for better control over the results.  There was also an attempt to incorporate a search query parameter `q`, but it's unclear if this functionality was ultimately retained.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/solution/get_folders/success.json` file was modified several times between 4:16 PM and 4:31 PM on July 1st, 2025. The key change involved updating the `meta` section to include `page` and `per_page` information, reflecting the pagination added to the API endpoint. The number of folders returned also decreased from 12 to 2.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/solution/get_subfolders_and_articles/success.json` file was updated once at 4:18 PM, then again at 4:18:25 PM, showing a consistent structure representing folders and articles within them.  The most notable differences are in the formatting of empty curly braces in the `version` field of the article objects.


The overall pattern suggests an iterative process of refining the API documentation and response structure to support pagination and improved search functionality, particularly for retrieving solution folders and articles. The frequent updates to `solution.md` indicate a considerable amount of experimentation and refinement of the API specifications and documentation.
