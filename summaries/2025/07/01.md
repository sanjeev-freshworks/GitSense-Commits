# Activity Summary for 7/1/2025

## 10:40:37 AM
The log shows modifications to two files within a Flutter project on July 1st, 2025.

The `/melos.yaml` file (10:03:02 AM) details the project's build configuration using Melos.  It defines various scripts for tasks such as running analysis, formatting code, building, testing (unit and widget tests, with coverage and exclusion options for specific files/folders like auto-generated files, UI components, and test libraries), and managing internationalization (l10n) and Pigeon code generation. The file specifies Flutter SDK version 3.7.2 and Flutter version 3.29.2, and lists numerous dependencies including packages for state management (Flutter Bloc, Provider, GetIt, Rxdart, Freezed), UI (Cupertino Icons, Flutter SVG, Lottie, Shimmer, Infinite Scroll Pagination), networking (HTTP), file handling (File Picker, Image Picker), routing (Go Router), and testing (Flutter Test, Mockito, Bloc Test).

The `/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/pubspec.yaml` file (10:03:12 AM) is a pubspec file defining dependencies for a specific UI library (`common_ui`). It also uses Flutter SDK version 3.7.2 and Flutter version 3.29.2 and lists dependencies mirroring a subset of those in `melos.yaml`, specifically focusing on UI and state management tools.  It also includes references to other internal packages ( `core`, `core_ui`, `common_base`, `common_business`, `user_lib`), indicating a modular project structure.  The version of this library is listed as 0.0.1.  Assets are declared from `/assets/images/` and `/assets/raw/` folders.

In summary, the changes reflect updates to a large Flutter project's build configuration and a library's dependency list, both occurring within a minute of each other, suggesting a coordinated update. The use of Melos indicates a multi-package project.  The extensive testing scripts suggest a focus on thorough testing and coverage.


## 4:41:03 PM
The log shows modifications to documentation and response files related to Freshservice's solution API.  The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/solution/solution.md` file underwent numerous revisions between 3:54 PM and 4:32 PM on July 1st, 2025.  These revisions primarily focused on refining the API documentation, specifically the descriptions for retrieving folders and subfolders with articles. Initially, the documentation included sections for "Get Categories," "Get Search Solutions," and "Get Solution Article Detail," but these were eventually removed, leaving only "Get Folders" and "Get Subfolders and Articles."

The API endpoint for retrieving folders changed from `/support/v2/solutions/:category_id` to `/api/_/solutions/folders`, and query parameters like `category_id`, `page`, and `per_page` were added for better control over the results.  There was also an attempt to incorporate a search query parameter `q`, but it's unclear if this functionality was ultimately retained.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/solution/get_folders/success.json` file was modified several times between 4:16 PM and 4:31 PM on July 1st, 2025. The key change involved updating the `meta` section to include `page` and `per_page` information, reflecting the pagination added to the API endpoint. The number of folders returned also decreased from 12 to 2.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/solution/get_subfolders_and_articles/success.json` file was updated once at 4:18 PM, then again at 4:18:25 PM, showing a consistent structure representing folders and articles within them.  The most notable differences are in the formatting of empty curly braces in the `version` field of the article objects.


The overall pattern suggests an iterative process of refining the API documentation and response structure to support pagination and improved search functionality, particularly for retrieving solution folders and articles. The frequent updates to `solution.md` indicate a considerable amount of experimentation and refinement of the API specifications and documentation.


## 5:41:08 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md` file between 5:12 PM and 5:16 PM on July 1st, 2025.  These changes involved modifications to prompts used for data layer code generation.  The core changes center around refining the API information source and parameters for a "solution" module. Initially, attempts were made using the `approval_lib` module before switching to `solution`.  The response source JSON files within the `freshservice_mobile_api_mock` directory were adjusted several times.   There was also a change in the query parameter `approval_filter` to `category_id` and adjustment to `per_page` default value from 20 to 30.   The `Note` section remained consistent across all prompts, outlining file naming conventions for remote constants, data source, repository, and mapper files.

Subsequent changes (5:20 PM onwards) reflect the actual code generation and implementation within the `features/solution` directory.  New files were created or modified related to the solution module's data layer:

* **`solution_remote_constants.dart` (5:20 PM):** This file defines constants for solution APIs and parameters, including paths like `/api/_/solutions/categories` and `/api/_/solutions/folders`, and parameters such as `page`, `perPage`, and `categoryId`.

* **`get_solution_folders_request_model.dart` (5:20 PM):** This file defines a model for the request to get solution folders, using the `freezed` package for efficient data handling.

* **`get_solution_folders_request_mapper.dart` (5:20 PM, multiple revisions):**  This mapper translates the request model into query parameters for API calls.  It went through multiple revisions, primarily focusing on code formatting and ensuring correct key names in mapping to the backend.

* **`solution_folder_response_api_model.dart` (5:22 PM, multiple revisions):**  This defines a model for the API response representing a solution folder.  It uses `freezed` or subsequently `json_annotation` package for serialization, specifying fields like `id`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `name`, and other metadata.  The change to `json_annotation` suggests a shift in the serialization strategy.

* **`solution_folder_meta.dart` (5:23 PM):** A model for metadata related to the solution folder response (pagination information).

* **`solution_folder_meta_response_api_model_mapper.dart` (5:24 PM):** A mapper for transforming the API response metadata.

* **`solution_remote_data_source.dart` (5:24 PM, multiple revisions):** This file contains the remote data source implementation, using `FSBaseRemoteDataSource` and handling API calls for fetching solution categories and folders.

* **`solution.dart` (5:26 PM):**  Serves as an export file for the solution feature, grouping related data and model exports for easy access from other parts of the application.

The final changes in `solution_remote_constants.dart`, `get_solution_folders_request_mapper.dart`, `get_solution_folders_response_api_model.dart`, and `solution_folder_response_api_model.dart` refine the structure to more closely align with standard Dart practices, with a clear separation of concerns and a shift towards more concise code.  The use of `freezed` and `json_annotation` is a key pattern in the code, showing a focus on type safety and efficient data handling. The `toDataModel()` and `toQueryParameters()` functions are recurring elements highlighting the use of mapper classes.


## 7:13:32 PM
The log shows a series of code changes within the `solution` feature of a Flutter application, likely related to fetching and handling solution folders.  The changes span from 5:44 PM to 6:15 PM on July 1st, 2025.

Several files related to data models and data sources were updated.  There is a consistent pattern of using `freezed` for data models and `json_annotation` for API models, indicating a focus on code generation and type safety.

Specifically:

* **Model layer:**  `get_solution_folders_request_model.dart`, `get_solution_folders_response_model.dart`, `solution_folders_request_model.dart`,  and multiple versions of `solution_folders.dart`  were modified. These changes center around defining data structures for requests and responses related to solution folders, using `freezed` for code generation and immutability. The models consistently include `folders` (a list) and `meta` (metadata) fields.

* **API model layer:**  `solution_folders_response_api_model.dart` and `get_solution_folders_response_api_model.dart` were created and modified, using `json_annotation` for JSON serialization and deserialization.  These files mirror the structure of the corresponding data models.

* **Mapper layer:**  `get_solution_folders_response_api_model_mapper.dart` and `solution_folders_response_api_model_mapper.dart` were created to map between API models and data models.

* **Data source layer:** `solution_remote_data_source.dart` underwent multiple edits,  primarily focusing on the `getSolutionFolders` function, which fetches solution folder data from a remote API. This function uses the defined request and response models and mappers. The `getSolutionCategories` function was also implemented here, suggesting retrieval of solution categories as well.


* **Repository layer:** `solution_repository_impl.dart` was updated to provide access to solution data, delegating calls to the remote data source.

* **Library file:** `solution.dart` was updated, likely to include the newly added modules.


The repeated edits to `solution_remote_data_source.dart` between 6:00 PM and 6:01 PM suggest minor adjustments or debugging.  The overall change pattern indicates a structured approach to building the solution feature, involving distinct layers for models, mappers, and data sources.
