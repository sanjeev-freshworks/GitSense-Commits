# Activity Summary for 7/3/2025

## 12:14:59 PM
The log shows a series of code changes within the `solution` module of a Flutter project, primarily focused on data models and data source interactions.  The changes span from 11:39 AM to 12:14 PM on July 3rd, 2025.

**`pubspec.yaml` (11:39:52 AM):** This file defines project dependencies, including core packages like `flutter_bloc`, `go_router`, and several custom packages (`core`, `common_base`, `common_business`, `common_ui`, `common_test`, `solution_lib`, `http_client`, `user_lib`).  The `solution` module's version is set to `0.0.1`.

**`solution_folder.dart` (11:40:14 AM, 11:40:30 AM):** This file defines a `SolutionFolder` data model using the `freezed` package.  A notable change between the two timestamps is the modification of `description` and `name` fields from nullable (`String?`) to non-nullable (`required String`).

**`solution_folder_meta.dart` (11:44:19 AM, 11:44:29 AM, 11:44:40 AM):**  This file defines a `SolutionFolderMeta` data model representing metadata (count, page, perPage).  There were multiple edits, seemingly correcting the default value for `count` and experimenting with optional values for `count`, `page`, and `perPage` before settling on default values for the latter two.

**`solution_folders_query.dart` (11:45:55 AM, 11:46:09 AM, 11:46:20 AM, 11:46:28 AM):** This file defines a `SolutionFoldersQuery` class for querying solution folders. The `page` parameter changed from having a default value of 1 to being marked `required` , before finally defaulting only `perPage` to 30.


**`solution_remote_data_source.dart` (11:48:54 AM):** This file contains the remote data source for solution folders, defining methods `getSolutionCategories` and `getSolutionFolders` using a base `FSBaseRemoteDataSource`.  It utilizes mappers for request and response transformations.

**`solution_folders_list_request_mapper.dart` (11:50:51 AM, 11:51:03 AM, 12:11:10 PM, 12:11:31 PM):** This file defines a mapper to convert `SolutionFoldersQuery` objects to query parameters for API requests. The filename appears inconsistent with the extension, suggesting possible renaming or refactoring.

**`solution_folders_list_meta_response_api_model_mapper.dart` (12:11:45 PM, 12:11:54 PM) and `solution_folders_meta_response_api_model_mapper.dart` (12:12:51 PM, 12:14:03 PM, 12:14:19 PM):** These files contain mappers for transforming API responses related to solution folder metadata into data models. The filename is inconsistent between the mapper and model names, suggesting a possible renaming or inconsistency.

**`solution_folders_meta_response_api_model.dart` (12:13:05 PM, 12:14:29 PM):** This file defines the API response model for solution folder metadata using `json_annotation`.

In summary, the majority of changes are focused on refining data models, handling nullable values, managing API requests, and ensuring consistent mapping between API responses and internal data structures. The multiple edits to several files suggest iterative development and debugging.  There's a pattern of using `freezed` for data models and custom mappers for data transformation between the API and the application's internal representation. The inconsistency in some filenames hints at possible refactoring during the development process.
