# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 1:07:20 PM
The log shows changes across two main files between 9:25 AM and 12:54 PM on July 10, 2025.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/article_model.dart` underwent a minor change between 9:25 AM and 9:26 AM.  The `ArticleModel` class was modified to use `final` instead of `int` for its member variables, indicating a shift towards immutability.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/solution_remote_constants.dart` saw multiple edits between 11:42 AM and 11:44 AM.  These changes involved adding a new constant, `folderId`, to the `SolutionRemoteConstants` class within the `Solution API Params` region.  There were also some minor, seemingly inconsequential edits involving a stray comment character in one of the commits.  The constants defined in this file appear to represent API endpoints and parameters related to solutions, categories, folders, and articles.


## 2:07:20 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/presentation/model/sample_prompt.prompt.md` between 1:51 PM and 2:03 PM on July 10, 2025.  The changes consistently involve updating the `Run the prompt` command, which always targets `generic_presentation_layer_models_codegen.prompt.md`.

Initially, the file path to `generic_presentation_layer_models_codegen.prompt.md` was included in various ways, with absolute and relative paths being experimented with.  Later edits introduced and refined the following inputs for the prompt:

* **Feature Path:** Consistently set to `features/solution`.
* **Technical Design document:**  Settled on `../../../instructions/ui/solution_tech_design.pdf`.
* **PRD file path:** Settled on `../../../instructions/ui/solution_prd.md`.
* **Localization file Path:** Settled on `libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb`.
* **Task specific notes:** These notes evolved gradually, eventually focusing the task on generating code for viewing folders list for agents only within the "3. View Category/Folder/Solution details" section, specifically referencing the  `Agent Folder List Solution Diagram` heading in the technical design document.

The most significant changes occurred between 1:56 PM and 2:03 PM, refining the inputs to achieve the specified task focus.  Multiple consecutive entries (2:03 PM) show identical code, suggesting potential accidental repeated saves or a brief pause in the refinement process.
