# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 1:07:20 PM
The log shows changes across two main files between 9:25 AM and 12:54 PM on July 10, 2025.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/article_model.dart` underwent a minor change between 9:25 AM and 9:26 AM.  The `ArticleModel` class was modified to use `final` instead of `int` for its member variables, indicating a shift towards immutability.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/solution_remote_constants.dart` saw multiple edits between 11:42 AM and 11:44 AM.  These changes involved adding a new constant, `folderId`, to the `SolutionRemoteConstants` class within the `Solution API Params` region.  There were also some minor, seemingly inconsequential edits involving a stray comment character in one of the commits.  The constants defined in this file appear to represent API endpoints and parameters related to solutions, categories, folders, and articles.


## 2:07:20 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/presentation/model/sample_prompt.prompt.md` between 1:51 PM and 2:03 PM on July 10, 2025.  The changes consistently involve updating the `Run the prompt` command, which always targets `generic_presentation_layer_models_codegen.prompt.md`.

Initially, the file path to `generic_presentation_layer_models_codegen.prompt.md` was included in various ways, with absolute and relative paths being experimented with.  Later edits introduced and refined the following inputs for the prompt:

* **Feature Path:** Consistently set to `features/solution`.
* **Technical Design document:**  Settled on `../../../instructions/ui/solution_tech_design.pdf`.
* **PRD file path:** Settled on `../../../instructions/ui/solution_prd.md`.
* **Localization file Path:** Settled on `libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb`.
* **Task specific notes:** These notes evolved gradually, eventually focusing the task on generating code for viewing folders list for agents only within the "3. View Category/Folder/Solution details" section, specifically referencing the  `Agent Folder List Solution Diagram` heading in the technical design document.

The most significant changes occurred between 1:56 PM and 2:03 PM, refining the inputs to achieve the specified task focus.  Multiple consecutive entries (2:03 PM) show identical code, suggesting potential accidental repeated saves or a brief pause in the refinement process.


## 3:07:40 PM
The log shows a significant refactoring of the solution folder list feature, moving it from the `support_portal` feature to a new `solution_lib` library.  This involved migrating several files between 2:08 PM and 2:40 PM on July 10, 2025.

The migration includes the movement of model files (`solution_folder_list_event.dart`, `solution_folder_list_state.dart`, `solution_folder_list_navigation_state.dart`), presentation layer files (`solution_folder_list_ui_model_mapper.dart`), and view components (`solution_folder_list_item.dart`, `solution_folder_list_content.dart`).  There were multiple, nearly identical entries for several files indicating potential repeated commits or unintentional saves.

Between 2:19 PM and 2:25 PM, there were multiple commits of `solution_folder_list_event.dart`  and `solution_folder_list_state.dart` without any code changes. Similarly, there were multiple commits with no code changes between 2:23 PM and 2:27 PM for `solution_folder_list_navigation_state.dart`, and between 2:34 PM and 2:37 PM for `solution_folder_list_ui_model_mapper.dart`.

The `solution_lib` now includes `common_ui`, `freezed_annotation`, and other dependencies as reflected in the `pubspec.yaml` update at 2:43 PM.  A `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` file (updated at 2:30 PM) details the changes, highlighting the addition of abstractions (`SolutionFolderLocalizations`, `SolutionFolderContentLocalizations`, `FSEventHandler`) and the implementation of the adapter pattern to maintain backward compatibility with the `support_portal` feature. The `support_portal` feature now re-exports components from `solution_lib`.

Localization files (`intl_en.arb`) were updated in both `solution_lib` (at 2:32 PM and 2:33 PM) and `support_portal` (at 2:33 PM), suggesting changes to the supported strings for the solution folder list.

Finally, minor adjustments were made in the `support_portal`'s `popular_articles_screen_root.dart` between 2:51 PM and 2:55 PM, likely to reflect the localization changes or other minor UI adaptations.  The final changes to this file involve correcting the import statement for localization at 2:54 PM to use `support_portal`'s localizations instead of `solution_lib`'s.


Between 3:03 PM and 3:06 PM several commits were made to the mapper files in the `solution` feature,  introducing constants for entity types and improving the mapper logic.  These changes seem unrelated to the initial library migration.
