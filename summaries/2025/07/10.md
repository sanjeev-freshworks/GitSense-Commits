# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 1:07:20 PM
The log shows changes across two main files between 9:25 AM and 12:54 PM on July 10, 2025.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/article_model.dart` underwent a minor change between 9:25 AM and 9:26 AM.  The `ArticleModel` class was modified to use `final` instead of `int` for its member variables, indicating a shift towards immutability.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/solution_remote_constants.dart` saw multiple edits between 11:42 AM and 11:44 AM.  These changes involved adding a new constant, `folderId`, to the `SolutionRemoteConstants` class within the `Solution API Params` region.  There were also some minor, seemingly inconsequential edits involving a stray comment character in one of the commits.  The constants defined in this file appear to represent API endpoints and parameters related to solutions, categories, folders, and articles.
