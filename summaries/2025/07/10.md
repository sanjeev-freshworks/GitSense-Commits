# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 1:07:20 PM
The log shows changes across two main files between 9:25 AM and 12:54 PM on July 10, 2025.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/article_model.dart` underwent a minor change between 9:25 AM and 9:26 AM.  The `ArticleModel` class was modified to use `final` instead of `int` for its member variables, indicating a shift towards immutability.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/solution_remote_constants.dart` saw multiple edits between 11:42 AM and 11:44 AM.  These changes involved adding a new constant, `folderId`, to the `SolutionRemoteConstants` class within the `Solution API Params` region.  There were also some minor, seemingly inconsequential edits involving a stray comment character in one of the commits.  The constants defined in this file appear to represent API endpoints and parameters related to solutions, categories, folders, and articles.


## 2:07:20 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/presentation/model/sample_prompt.prompt.md` between 1:51 PM and 2:03 PM on July 10, 2025.  The changes consistently involve updating the `Run the prompt` command, which always targets `generic_presentation_layer_models_codegen.prompt.md`.

Initially, the file path to `generic_presentation_layer_models_codegen.prompt.md` was included in various ways, with absolute and relative paths being experimented with.  Later edits introduced and refined the following inputs for the prompt:

* **Feature Path:** Consistently set to `features/solution`.
* **Technical Design document:**  Settled on `../../../instructions/ui/solution_tech_design.pdf`.
* **PRD file path:** Settled on `../../../instructions/ui/solution_prd.md`.
* **Localization file Path:** Settled on `libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb`.
* **Task specific notes:** These notes evolved gradually, eventually focusing the task on generating code for viewing folders list for agents only within the "3. View Category/Folder/Solution details" section, specifically referencing the  `Agent Folder List Solution Diagram` heading in the technical design document.

The most significant changes occurred between 1:56 PM and 2:03 PM, refining the inputs to achieve the specified task focus.  Multiple consecutive entries (2:03 PM) show identical code, suggesting potential accidental repeated saves or a brief pause in the refinement process.


## 3:07:40 PM
The log shows a significant refactoring of the solution folder list feature, moving it from the `support_portal` feature to a new `solution_lib` library.  This involved migrating several files between 2:08 PM and 2:40 PM on July 10, 2025.

The migration includes the movement of model files (`solution_folder_list_event.dart`, `solution_folder_list_state.dart`, `solution_folder_list_navigation_state.dart`), presentation layer files (`solution_folder_list_ui_model_mapper.dart`), and view components (`solution_folder_list_item.dart`, `solution_folder_list_content.dart`).  There were multiple, nearly identical entries for several files indicating potential repeated commits or unintentional saves.

Between 2:19 PM and 2:25 PM, there were multiple commits of `solution_folder_list_event.dart`  and `solution_folder_list_state.dart` without any code changes. Similarly, there were multiple commits with no code changes between 2:23 PM and 2:27 PM for `solution_folder_list_navigation_state.dart`, and between 2:34 PM and 2:37 PM for `solution_folder_list_ui_model_mapper.dart`.

The `solution_lib` now includes `common_ui`, `freezed_annotation`, and other dependencies as reflected in the `pubspec.yaml` update at 2:43 PM.  A `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` file (updated at 2:30 PM) details the changes, highlighting the addition of abstractions (`SolutionFolderLocalizations`, `SolutionFolderContentLocalizations`, `FSEventHandler`) and the implementation of the adapter pattern to maintain backward compatibility with the `support_portal` feature. The `support_portal` feature now re-exports components from `solution_lib`.

Localization files (`intl_en.arb`) were updated in both `solution_lib` (at 2:32 PM and 2:33 PM) and `support_portal` (at 2:33 PM), suggesting changes to the supported strings for the solution folder list.

Finally, minor adjustments were made in the `support_portal`'s `popular_articles_screen_root.dart` between 2:51 PM and 2:55 PM, likely to reflect the localization changes or other minor UI adaptations.  The final changes to this file involve correcting the import statement for localization at 2:54 PM to use `support_portal`'s localizations instead of `solution_lib`'s.


Between 3:03 PM and 3:06 PM several commits were made to the mapper files in the `solution` feature,  introducing constants for entity types and improving the mapper logic.  These changes seem unrelated to the initial library migration.


## 5:07:37 PM
Between 3:07 PM and 3:09 PM on July 10, 2025, the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/solution_subfolders_and_articles_entity_api_model_mapper.dart` received minor updates.  A new constant `_entityTypeExternalArticle` was added to handle external articles.

From 3:29 PM to 3:33 PM on July 10, 2025, the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` underwent several revisions.  Initially, the pluralization for "folder" and "article" counts used the `many` keyword. This was changed to `other` and then additional metadata (`@folderCountLabel`, `@articlesCountLabel`) was added with descriptions and placeholder type declarations, ultimately specifying "count" as an integer.


From 3:39 PM to 3:45 PM on July 10, 2025,  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/src/ui/solution_folder/view/component/solution_folder_list_content.dart` was modified multiple times.  The key change was a shift from using `SupportPortalUIImages.icEmptyFolderList` to `SolutionLibUIImages.icEmptyFolderList` for the empty folder indicator image,  along with a related change in the localizations context from `context.supportPortalLoc` to `context.solutionLibLoc`.  There were also some transient changes in the `PagingState` type, temporarily reverting to using `PagingState` before settling on `FSPagingState`.  The `infinite_scroll_pagination` import was removed and re-added during this period.


At 3:44 PM on July 10, 2025, the `pubspec.yaml` file for `solution_lib` was updated to include assets under `assets/images/`, likely to support the image changes in the `SolutionLibUIImages` class.


Between 4:32 PM and 4:34 PM on July 10, 2025, the `SolutionLibUiImages` class in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/res/solution_lib_ui_images.dart` was renamed to `SolutionLibUIImages` and an `icEmptyFolderList` image was added.

At 4:36 PM and 4:39 PM on July 10, 2025, the `solution_lib.dart` file was updated multiple times to include new exports for newly created classes and files related to the solution folder list UI components, including events, states, mapper, and view components.  Some exports were removed in the final version.


From 4:38 PM to 4:38 PM on July 10, 2025, the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/solution/folder/view/component/content/folder_list_content.dart`  was updated to use `SolutionLibUIImages.icEmptyFolderList`.


At 4:39 PM to 4:55 PM on July 10, 2025,  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/solution_v2/folder/presentation/bloc/solution_folder_list_bloc.dart` was refined.  The main change was removing unnecessary imports from `solution_lib`, streamlining imports to only necessary elements.


At 4:53 PM to 4:54 PM on July 10, 2025, the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/solution_v2/folder/model/solution_folder_list_state.dart` had its imports adjusted to correctly specify the `solution_lib` library and avoid naming conflicts.

From 4:57 PM to 4:57 PM on July 10, 2025, the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/solution_lib.dart` had several exports removed, likely to separate internal implementation details from the library's public API.

Between 4:58 PM and 5:00 PM on July 10, 2025, the files `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/src/ui/solution_folder/model/folder_list_event.dart`, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/src/ui/solution_folder/model/folder_list_navigation_state.dart`, and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/src/ui/solution_folder/model/folder_list_state.dart` were renamed to consolidate and create a consistent naming scheme.

At 5:05 PM on July 10, 2025, there were several updates to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/src/ui/solution_folder/model/folder_list_state.dart`. The key change was the addition of an import from `solution_lib/src/ui/solution_folder/model/solution_folder_list_navigation_state.dart`. This is likely due to using both `FolderListNavigationState` and `SolutionFolderListNavigationState` in the same file, indicating possible merge conflict. Multiple attempts were made before settling on the final version.

At 5:05 PM on July 10, 2025, a new component `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/src/ui/solution_folder/view/component/folder_list_item.dart` was created.

At 5:06 PM on July 10, 2025, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/res/solution_lib_ui_images.dart` was updated to add `icSolutionFolder` image.

At 5:07 PM on July 10, 2025, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/src/ui/solution_folder/view/folder_list_screen_root.dart` was updated to remove unnecessary imports.


## 6:07:36 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib` directory, primarily focusing on the UI and testing of a solution folder list feature.

Between 5:07 PM and 5:08 PM, the `folder_list_screen_root.dart` file underwent several revisions.  These changes primarily involved correcting typos and inconsistencies in class and state names related to `SolutionFolderListState`, `SolutionFolderListStateContent`, and `SolutionFolderListStateLoading`. The core functionality remained unchanged.

At 5:11 PM and 5:12 PM, `folder_list_item.dart` and `common_solution_folder_list_item.dart` were created or modified, both containing nearly identical code for rendering list items using `FSListTile` and `FSImage` components.  This suggests a refactoring to create a common component for list items.

A significant change occurred between 5:12 PM and 5:22 PM in `common_solution_folder_list_screen_root.dart`.  This involved:

*   Replacing the placeholder loader (`FolderListLoading`) with a dedicated `FolderListLoader` component.
*   Removing unnecessary arguments from the `CommonFolderListScreenRoot` widget.
*   Adding `go_router` import for improved navigation.
*   Updating the back button functionality from `context.pop()` to `context.popOrFinish()` for better navigation handling.
*   Adding `common_ui` import.

At 5:19 PM,  `folder_list_screen_args.dart` was created, defining arguments for the folder list screen. This likely complements the changes made to `common_solution_folder_list_screen_root.dart`.

Between 5:28 PM and 5:47 PM, the `solution_folder_ui_model_mapper_test.dart` file underwent multiple revisions. The initial test focused on mapping a `SolutionFolder` to a `FolderUIModel`. Subsequent changes cleaned up imports, fixed typos in variable names (`SolutionFolder` to `Folder`), adjusted the mapper name (`SolutionFolderListUiModelMapper` to `FolderUiModelMapper`), added necessary imports, and improved test clarity and fixture usage.  This indicates iterative debugging and refinement of unit tests.  The final version uses the `FolderUiModelMapper` and related fixtures.

At 5:30 PM, new fixture files, `solution_folder_fixture.dart` and `folder_list_ui_model_fixture.dart`, were created to support the unit tests.  These provide sample data for testing the mapping process.

At 5:46 PM, `folder_ui_model_mapper.dart` was created/modified which handles the mapping of the `FolderModel` to `FolderUIModel` including localization.


At 5:53 PM - 5:54 PM,  `solution_lib.dart` was modified to export newly created classes and components related to the solution folder list UI, solidifying the changes across the library.

At 5:56 PM, files within the `features/support_portal` directory were updated, showing the integration of the `solution_lib` components into a feature-specific bloc (`solution_folder_list_bloc.dart`) and state (`solution_folder_list_state.dart`). This demonstrates the library's integration into a larger application.

Finally at 6:00 PM - 6:02 PM, files were renamed from `common_solution_folder_list_item.dart`/`common_solution_folder_list_content.dart` to `common_folder_list_item.dart`/`common_folder_list_content.dart` respectively suggesting a final renaming refactoring.  Additionally, at 6:04 PM,  `solution_lib_module.dart` and `folder_list_state.dart` were updated, potentially for final cleanup or minor bug fixes.

In summary, the changes reflect a focused effort to build, test, and integrate a new solution folder list feature in a Flutter application, involving UI development, testing, and dependency injection setup. The evolution of the code across multiple commits reveals a process of iterative refinement, debugging, and integration with other parts of the system.
