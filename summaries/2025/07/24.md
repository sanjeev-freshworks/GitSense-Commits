# Activity Summary for 7/24/2025

## 1:52:44 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/article_item_widget.dart` between 7/23/2025, 9:29:06 PM and 7/23/2025, 9:29:59 PM.  The file is a Flutter widget (`ArticleItemWidget`) displaying article information.

The initial version (9:29:06 PM) used `FSListTile` for a simple article display. Subsequent revisions (9:29:24 PM onwards) significantly changed the UI to a more detailed view within an `InkWell` for tap handling. This improved version includes:

*   A container with padding and a border.
*   Display of `article.articleName` and `article.description` with ellipsis for truncation.
*   `FSImage` for the article icon.
*   `FSUserAvatar` to show the author.
*   Display of `article.authorName`, `article.status`, `article.modifiedAt`, and view count.

The changes between 9:29:24 PM and 9:29:59 PM are purely stylistic and do not alter the functionality.  The final version is a visually enhanced, detailed article card, using nested `Row` and `Column` widgets for layout.  The consistent use of custom widgets like `FSImage`, `FSListTile`, and `FSUserAvatar` from other packages (`core_ui`, `solution_lib`) suggests a consistent design system is being employed.


## 10:40:41 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/article_item_widget.dart` between 9:40 AM and 9:58 AM on July 24, 2025.  The file underwent significant restructuring and styling changes.

Initially, the widget displayed article information using `FSCard`, `Row`, and `Column` widgets, with styling defined using a theme-based approach (`context.theme.fsTextTheme`).  Between 9:40 AM and 9:41 AM, a minor change was made, updating the author's name text style from `medium.caption` to `semibold.caption`.

At 9:48 AM, a major revision replaced the `FSCard` with `InkWell` and `Container`, introducing custom border and styling using standard `TextStyle` properties rather than the theme.  The `FSTag` widget was replaced by a custom `Container` for displaying the article status.

Subsequently, between 9:49 AM and 9:58 AM, the widget's structure was simplified considerably.  `FSListTile` was introduced to display the article title and leading image.  The author's information was displayed in a separate `Row` below the title. Several minor iterations during this period adjusted the styling and text properties using different variations of `context.theme.fsTextTheme` and finally settling on  `context.theme.fsTextTheme.regular.body` with secondary text color.  The author's image was changed from `icSolutionFolder` to `icAuthor` around 9:52 AM. Finally, at 9:58 AM padding was added around the author information row.

Separately, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/res/solution_lib_ui_images.dart` was updated at 9:49:02 AM.  This file defines several `FSLocalImageInfo` constants for SVG images used in the `article_item_widget.dart` file, including images for folders, articles, and authors.  This change likely supplied the image assets used in the UI component.
