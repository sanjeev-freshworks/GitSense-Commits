# Activity Summary for 7/24/2025

## 1:52:44 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/article_item_widget.dart` between 7/23/2025, 9:29:06 PM and 7/23/2025, 9:29:59 PM.  The file is a Flutter widget (`ArticleItemWidget`) displaying article information.

The initial version (9:29:06 PM) used `FSListTile` for a simple article display. Subsequent revisions (9:29:24 PM onwards) significantly changed the UI to a more detailed view within an `InkWell` for tap handling. This improved version includes:

*   A container with padding and a border.
*   Display of `article.articleName` and `article.description` with ellipsis for truncation.
*   `FSImage` for the article icon.
*   `FSUserAvatar` to show the author.
*   Display of `article.authorName`, `article.status`, `article.modifiedAt`, and view count.

The changes between 9:29:24 PM and 9:29:59 PM are purely stylistic and do not alter the functionality.  The final version is a visually enhanced, detailed article card, using nested `Row` and `Column` widgets for layout.  The consistent use of custom widgets like `FSImage`, `FSListTile`, and `FSUserAvatar` from other packages (`core_ui`, `solution_lib`) suggests a consistent design system is being employed.


## 10:40:41 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/article_item_widget.dart` between 9:40 AM and 9:58 AM on July 24, 2025.  The file underwent significant restructuring and styling changes.

Initially, the widget displayed article information using `FSCard`, `Row`, and `Column` widgets, with styling defined using a theme-based approach (`context.theme.fsTextTheme`).  Between 9:40 AM and 9:41 AM, a minor change was made, updating the author's name text style from `medium.caption` to `semibold.caption`.

At 9:48 AM, a major revision replaced the `FSCard` with `InkWell` and `Container`, introducing custom border and styling using standard `TextStyle` properties rather than the theme.  The `FSTag` widget was replaced by a custom `Container` for displaying the article status.

Subsequently, between 9:49 AM and 9:58 AM, the widget's structure was simplified considerably.  `FSListTile` was introduced to display the article title and leading image.  The author's information was displayed in a separate `Row` below the title. Several minor iterations during this period adjusted the styling and text properties using different variations of `context.theme.fsTextTheme` and finally settling on  `context.theme.fsTextTheme.regular.body` with secondary text color.  The author's image was changed from `icSolutionFolder` to `icAuthor` around 9:52 AM. Finally, at 9:58 AM padding was added around the author information row.

Separately, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/res/solution_lib_ui_images.dart` was updated at 9:49:02 AM.  This file defines several `FSLocalImageInfo` constants for SVG images used in the `article_item_widget.dart` file, including images for folders, articles, and authors.  This change likely supplied the image assets used in the UI component.


## 11:48:13 AM
The log shows the iterative development of a `FolderListItem` widget in a Flutter application.  The widget displays information from a `FolderUIModel` object.

The initial version (11:10:13 AM) was an empty `Column`.  Subsequent changes progressively added elements:

* **11:10:35 AM:** An `FSImage` was added to display a folder icon.
* **11:10:51 AM:**  The widget was restructured using `FSListTile`, showing the folder name (`uiModel.name`) and meta-information (`uiModel.folderMetaInfo`).  The `onTap` callback was incorporated.
* **11:10:58 AM - 11:11:57 AM:** Several intermediate commits show experimentation and temporary code removal/addition, mostly around the `FSListTile` and `FSImage` elements.  These are likely temporary steps during refactoring.
* **11:12:17 AM - 11:15:01 AM:**  `FSListTile` was removed; the layout shifted to a `Row` within a `Column`. A `Text` widget displaying the folder name was added along with spacing using `SizedBox`.  The code was stabilized by 11:15:01 AM.
* **11:15:29 AM - 11:17:47 AM:**  Conditional rendering was introduced using an `if` statement to display the `folderMetaInfo` only if it's not null. Minor styling changes to text color and font weight were made.
* **11:18:53 AM - 11:21:57 AM:** Padding was added around the `Column` using `Padding` and `EdgeInsets`.  The `GestureDetector` was added to make the entire item tappable, replaced later with `InkWell`.
* **11:24:28 AM - 11:30:13 AM:** The `Expanded` widget was removed from around the Text widget showing `uiModel.name`,  `MainAxisAlignment` and `CrossAxisAlignment` were added to the `Column` and the `folderMetaInfo` was wrapped in a `Container` for easier styling.
* **11:32:21 AM - 11:35:16 AM:** The `Column` was changed to a `Row` to achieve a single-line layout. Further refinements to the layout and final adjustments to the styling and conditional rendering were made. The final version uses a `Row` containing an `FSImage` and a `Column` with the name and (optional) meta-information.

The consistent use of custom widgets (`FSImage`, `FSListTile`) and a consistent theme-based styling (`context.theme.fsTextTheme`) are recurring elements. The major restructuring happened between 11:10:51 AM and 11:12:17 AM, and the final styling was completed by 11:35:16 AM.


## 2:07:07 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/article_item_widget.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_list/presentation/mapper/folder_ui_model_mapper.dart` between 12:25 PM and 1:21 PM on July 24, 2025.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/article_item_widget.dart`**:  This file underwent significant changes throughout the log. Initially, it displayed a simple row layout for articles.  Over time, the UI was enhanced to include author information (author name, and an icon), view count, and an eye icon,  resulting in a more visually informative article item. The commented-out code suggests a previous version used `FSListTile`, which was replaced by a custom `Row`-based layout.  The most significant changes occurred between 12:55 PM and 1:21 PM, where the author's name, view count, and an eye icon were added.  Import statements were also modified to include `common_ui` package between 1:17 PM and 1:18 PM.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_list/presentation/mapper/folder_ui_model_mapper.dart`**: This file was modified twice, with minor updates between 12:58 PM and 12:59 PM. The change involved simplifying the `_getFolderMetaInfo` function by removing the bullet character ('â€¢') from the string concatenation.  This indicates a minor refactoring step in data presentation.

In summary, the major development effort focused on improving the UI of the article item widget, adding visual elements for author, views, and  an eye icon, refining the layout, and removing unnecessary complexities in the meta-information mapping.  The changes show an iterative development process with numerous minor revisions improving the design and functionality.
