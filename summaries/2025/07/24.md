# Activity Summary for 7/24/2025

## 1:52:44 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/article_item_widget.dart` between 7/23/2025, 9:29:06 PM and 7/23/2025, 9:29:59 PM.  The file is a Flutter widget (`ArticleItemWidget`) displaying article information.

The initial version (9:29:06 PM) used `FSListTile` for a simple article display. Subsequent revisions (9:29:24 PM onwards) significantly changed the UI to a more detailed view within an `InkWell` for tap handling. This improved version includes:

*   A container with padding and a border.
*   Display of `article.articleName` and `article.description` with ellipsis for truncation.
*   `FSImage` for the article icon.
*   `FSUserAvatar` to show the author.
*   Display of `article.authorName`, `article.status`, `article.modifiedAt`, and view count.

The changes between 9:29:24 PM and 9:29:59 PM are purely stylistic and do not alter the functionality.  The final version is a visually enhanced, detailed article card, using nested `Row` and `Column` widgets for layout.  The consistent use of custom widgets like `FSImage`, `FSListTile`, and `FSUserAvatar` from other packages (`core_ui`, `solution_lib`) suggests a consistent design system is being employed.


## 10:40:41 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/article_item_widget.dart` between 9:40 AM and 9:58 AM on July 24, 2025.  The file underwent significant restructuring and styling changes.

Initially, the widget displayed article information using `FSCard`, `Row`, and `Column` widgets, with styling defined using a theme-based approach (`context.theme.fsTextTheme`).  Between 9:40 AM and 9:41 AM, a minor change was made, updating the author's name text style from `medium.caption` to `semibold.caption`.

At 9:48 AM, a major revision replaced the `FSCard` with `InkWell` and `Container`, introducing custom border and styling using standard `TextStyle` properties rather than the theme.  The `FSTag` widget was replaced by a custom `Container` for displaying the article status.

Subsequently, between 9:49 AM and 9:58 AM, the widget's structure was simplified considerably.  `FSListTile` was introduced to display the article title and leading image.  The author's information was displayed in a separate `Row` below the title. Several minor iterations during this period adjusted the styling and text properties using different variations of `context.theme.fsTextTheme` and finally settling on  `context.theme.fsTextTheme.regular.body` with secondary text color.  The author's image was changed from `icSolutionFolder` to `icAuthor` around 9:52 AM. Finally, at 9:58 AM padding was added around the author information row.

Separately, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/res/solution_lib_ui_images.dart` was updated at 9:49:02 AM.  This file defines several `FSLocalImageInfo` constants for SVG images used in the `article_item_widget.dart` file, including images for folders, articles, and authors.  This change likely supplied the image assets used in the UI component.


## 11:48:13 AM
The log shows the iterative development of a `FolderListItem` widget in a Flutter application.  The widget displays information from a `FolderUIModel` object.

The initial version (11:10:13 AM) was an empty `Column`.  Subsequent changes progressively added elements:

* **11:10:35 AM:** An `FSImage` was added to display a folder icon.
* **11:10:51 AM:**  The widget was restructured using `FSListTile`, showing the folder name (`uiModel.name`) and meta-information (`uiModel.folderMetaInfo`).  The `onTap` callback was incorporated.
* **11:10:58 AM - 11:11:57 AM:** Several intermediate commits show experimentation and temporary code removal/addition, mostly around the `FSListTile` and `FSImage` elements.  These are likely temporary steps during refactoring.
* **11:12:17 AM - 11:15:01 AM:**  `FSListTile` was removed; the layout shifted to a `Row` within a `Column`. A `Text` widget displaying the folder name was added along with spacing using `SizedBox`.  The code was stabilized by 11:15:01 AM.
* **11:15:29 AM - 11:17:47 AM:**  Conditional rendering was introduced using an `if` statement to display the `folderMetaInfo` only if it's not null. Minor styling changes to text color and font weight were made.
* **11:18:53 AM - 11:21:57 AM:** Padding was added around the `Column` using `Padding` and `EdgeInsets`.  The `GestureDetector` was added to make the entire item tappable, replaced later with `InkWell`.
* **11:24:28 AM - 11:30:13 AM:** The `Expanded` widget was removed from around the Text widget showing `uiModel.name`,  `MainAxisAlignment` and `CrossAxisAlignment` were added to the `Column` and the `folderMetaInfo` was wrapped in a `Container` for easier styling.
* **11:32:21 AM - 11:35:16 AM:** The `Column` was changed to a `Row` to achieve a single-line layout. Further refinements to the layout and final adjustments to the styling and conditional rendering were made. The final version uses a `Row` containing an `FSImage` and a `Column` with the name and (optional) meta-information.

The consistent use of custom widgets (`FSImage`, `FSListTile`) and a consistent theme-based styling (`context.theme.fsTextTheme`) are recurring elements. The major restructuring happened between 11:10:51 AM and 11:12:17 AM, and the final styling was completed by 11:35:16 AM.


## 2:07:07 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/article_item_widget.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_list/presentation/mapper/folder_ui_model_mapper.dart` between 12:25 PM and 1:21 PM on July 24, 2025.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/article_item_widget.dart`**:  This file underwent significant changes throughout the log. Initially, it displayed a simple row layout for articles.  Over time, the UI was enhanced to include author information (author name, and an icon), view count, and an eye icon,  resulting in a more visually informative article item. The commented-out code suggests a previous version used `FSListTile`, which was replaced by a custom `Row`-based layout.  The most significant changes occurred between 12:55 PM and 1:21 PM, where the author's name, view count, and an eye icon were added.  Import statements were also modified to include `common_ui` package between 1:17 PM and 1:18 PM.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_list/presentation/mapper/folder_ui_model_mapper.dart`**: This file was modified twice, with minor updates between 12:58 PM and 12:59 PM. The change involved simplifying the `_getFolderMetaInfo` function by removing the bullet character ('â€¢') from the string concatenation.  This indicates a minor refactoring step in data presentation.

In summary, the major development effort focused on improving the UI of the article item widget, adding visual elements for author, views, and  an eye icon, refining the layout, and removing unnecessary complexities in the meta-information mapping.  The changes show an iterative development process with numerous minor revisions improving the design and functionality.


## 3:07:07 PM
The log shows significant changes to two Dart files within a Flutter project, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/article_item_widget.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/folder_detail_content.dart`.  The changes span from 2:13 PM to 3:05 PM on July 24th, 2025.

`article_item_widget.dart`: This file underwent a substantial revision.  Initially (2:13 PM), it displayed article information using a `Column` layout. A later update (2:56 PM and 3:05 PM)  restructured the widget to use a `Row` layout, improving the visual presentation of article title, author, and views.  The `ArticleUiModel` was replaced with individual string parameters (`articleName`, `authorName`, `modifiedAt`, `views`), making the widget more flexible and reusable.  Image sizes and margins were adjusted throughout these updates.

`folder_detail_content.dart`: This file contains a `PagedListView` that displays folders and articles. The most significant changes  occurred between 2:58 PM and 3:05 PM. The initial version contained a switch statement within the `itemBuilder`  function of the `PagedListView` to render different widgets (`FolderListItem`, `ArticleItemWidget`, `ExternalArticleItemWidget`) based on the type of `FolderItemUIModel`. Subsequent modifications refined this switch statement to call dedicated helper functions (`_buildFolderItem`, `_buildArticleItem`, `_buildExternalArticleItem`) for better code organization and readability. The import statements also changed to include specific UI models like `article_ui_model.dart`, `external_article_ui_model.dart`, and `folder_item_ui_model.dart`.  These improvements aim to enhance code maintainability and clarity.  The final version uses a switch statement to directly render the appropriate widget for each `FolderItemUIModel` type.  This series of edits shows a clear progression towards improved structure and maintainability of the code.


## 4:07:13 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/article_item_widget.dart`  between 3:08 PM and 4:04 PM on July 24, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes was refactoring the `ArticleItemWidget` to improve its structure and readability.

Initially, the `build` method contained all the UI logic.  Subsequent edits extracted parts of this logic into separate helper methods: `_buildSubtext` and `_buildModifiedDate`, later simplifying to just `_buildSubtext`.  The `_buildSubtext` method was further refined,  initially containing hardcoded text ("authorNameauthorName..."), then evolving to correctly utilize the `authorName` and `views` properties.  A significant change involved replacing the `Expanded` widget within `_buildSubtext` with a `Flexible` widget to handle author name text wrapping more gracefully.  The `_buildSubtext` method was finally broken into `_buildAuthorView` and `_buildViewsCountView` to separate the author and views information into independent widgets.

Around 3:15 PM, the `Column` widget containing the article information was wrapped with an `Expanded` widget to handle layout constraints efficiently.  The `articleName` and `modifiedAt` Texts were given `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis` and `maxLines:2` properties.  Finally, a conditional statement was added to include an `FSTag` (presumably a custom tag widget from `solution_lib`) displaying the `status` property if it's not null and not empty.

The changes between 3:46 PM and 3:50 PM involved moving the outer `Container` inside the `InkWell` widget and removing `import` statements for components no longer directly used in the class, resulting in a cleaner widget structure.  A `status` variable was added to the widget, which is conditionally rendered as an FSTag.  The conditional rendering of the FSTag was also improved for clarity.

In summary, the code evolution demonstrates a progression from a monolithic `build` method to a more modular design with helper functions and widgets for better maintainability, readability and flexibility in displaying article information, with final additions of a conditional status tag and consistent use of `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis`. The `FolderDetailContent.dart` file was also updated to incorporate the new `status` property in the `ArticleItemWidget` and to show it as a tag.


## 4:07:35 PM
The code changes primarily involve the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory, focusing on data models and mappers related to solution folders and articles.

Between 3:27 PM and 3:30 PM on July 24, 2025, several files underwent modifications.  `solution_subfolders_and_articles_meta_api_model.dart` was updated twice within a short time frame, with the second update changing the `totalPages` field from `String` to `int`. `solution_folders_meta_response_api_model.dart` defines a new data model for solution folder metadata.  `solution_folders_meta_response_api_model_mapper.dart` was modified multiple times, with the most significant change at 3:30:13 PM converting both the `page` and `perPage` fields to integers within the `toDataModel()` function.  This suggests a consistent effort to ensure data type consistency and potentially handle potential parsing errors.

Finally, at 3:35:44 PM, `solution_folders_response_api_model_mapper_test.dart` contains comprehensive unit tests covering various scenarios for mapping `SolutionFoldersResponseApiModel` to its data model counterpart, including null and empty values, and handling cases where some folders might have null IDs.  These tests suggest a focus on robust error handling and data validation.  The tests show a thorough approach to testing the mapper's ability to handle various input conditions, paying particular attention to how null and empty values are handled.


## 6:07:09 PM
The log shows a series of changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, specifically within the `freshservice_mobile_api_mock` and `features/support_portal` directories.

Initially, a `success.json` file was updated (7/24/2025, 5:27:55 PM) to contain sample data for a support portal solution's related articles.  Concurrently, the `/support_solution.md` documentation file underwent several revisions (between 7/24/2025, 5:28:46 PM and 7/24/2025, 5:33:53 PM), detailing various API endpoints for support portal solutions. These revisions added a `Get Related Articles` section and refined the API path and parameters for this endpoint, eventually settling on  `/support/search/articles/:article_id/related_articles` with a `limit` query parameter.  The documentation consistently references several JSON response files located within the `freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response` directory which supply sample data for the respective API calls.

Subsequently, a series of changes were made to `/sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md` (between 7/24/2025, 5:41:00 PM and 7/24/2025, 5:51:12 PM). These modifications reflect iterative refinement of instructions for a code generation prompt. The prompt aims to generate data layer code (models, data sources, repositories) for the "Get Related Articles" functionality. The specifications evolved, particularly concerning the query parameters (`page`, `per_page`, `approval_filter` initially, eventually stabilizing on `limit`, and `article_id` as a path parameter), response enums (`priority`), and date time formatting of fields, ultimately omitting enums and date time handling. File naming conventions for generated files are also repeatedly refined.  There was also a significant shift in file location parameters for generated code.

Finally, numerous Dart files were added or updated within the `features/support_portal` directory (between 7/24/2025, 5:49:29 PM and 7/24/2025, 5:59:09 PM). These files implement the data layer components outlined in the code generation prompt.  Specifically, `solution_support_remote_constants.dart` defines constants for API paths and parameters;  `related_article_api_model.dart` and `related_article.dart` define API and data models for related articles; and `get_related_articles_query_mapper.dart` handles query parameter mapping. The `solution_support_portal_remote_data_source_v2.dart`, `solution_support_portal_repository_v2.dart`, and `solution_support_portal_repository_v2_impl.dart` files implement the remote data source and repository for the "Get Related Articles" functionality, utilizing the mappers and models created earlier.  There's a final correction/refinement to related article model mapping in `get_related_article_api_model_mapper.dart`. The final changes made to `tech_design_diagram.md` (7/24/2025, 6:02:22 PM to 7/24/2025, 6:03:35 PM) document the design for the Get Related Articles use case. Finally, `sample_usecase_codegen.prompt.md` (7/24/2025, 6:04:04 PM to 7/24/2025, 6:06:28 PM) shows prompts to generate the use case code, with final version pointing to the correct api information and providing the articleId and limit for testing purposes.


## 10:40:31 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/domain/sample_usecase_codegen.prompt.md` between 6:07 PM and 6:10 PM on July 24, 2025.  These edits iteratively refine a prompt for code generation, specifically for a "Get Related Articles" use case within the `support_portal` module.  The prompt consistently references a tech design document, implementation scope, module details, and unit test details (including API information from specified files and Mockoon responses).  The key evolution is the progressive addition of file paths for the use case, its dependency injection registration, and its unit tests, culminating in the complete specification of locations for the use case code, its DI registration in `features/support_portal/lib/src/domain/di/solution_support_portal_domain_module.dart`,  tests in `features/support_portal/test/usecase/solution_v2`, and test helper files in `features/support_portal/test/usecase/helper`.

Between 6:16 PM and 6:21 PM, the `get_related_articles_use_case.dart` file was repeatedly modified, though the code itself remained unchanged during this period.  

At 6:18 PM, the `solution_support_portal_domain_module.dart` file was updated to register the `GetRelatedArticlesUseCase`.

The unit test file, `get_related_articles_use_case_test.dart`, was created and then remained unchanged between 6:20 PM and 6:24 PM. This file contains tests for the new use case covering different limit scenarios (with limit, without limit, zero limit, and negative limit).


At 6:20 PM, `solution_support_portal_remote_data_source_v2.dart`  was added,  containing methods for interacting with the remote data source. This includes methods for fetching popular articles, folder lists, subfolder and article lists, searching solution articles, and getting related articles.

Finally, between 6:22 PM and 6:23 PM, `solution_support_remote_constants.dart` was updated.  The significant change was altering the API path for related articles from `/support/solutions/articles/%1\$/related` to `/support/search/articles/%1\$/related_articles`.  This likely reflects a change in the API endpoint.  The test file `get_related_articles_use_case_test.dart`  remained unchanged after this final API path update.
