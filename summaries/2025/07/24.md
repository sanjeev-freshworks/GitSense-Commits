# Activity Summary for 7/24/2025

## 1:52:44 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/article_item_widget.dart` between 7/23/2025, 9:29:06 PM and 7/23/2025, 9:29:59 PM.  The file is a Flutter widget (`ArticleItemWidget`) displaying article information.

The initial version (9:29:06 PM) used `FSListTile` for a simple article display. Subsequent revisions (9:29:24 PM onwards) significantly changed the UI to a more detailed view within an `InkWell` for tap handling. This improved version includes:

*   A container with padding and a border.
*   Display of `article.articleName` and `article.description` with ellipsis for truncation.
*   `FSImage` for the article icon.
*   `FSUserAvatar` to show the author.
*   Display of `article.authorName`, `article.status`, `article.modifiedAt`, and view count.

The changes between 9:29:24 PM and 9:29:59 PM are purely stylistic and do not alter the functionality.  The final version is a visually enhanced, detailed article card, using nested `Row` and `Column` widgets for layout.  The consistent use of custom widgets like `FSImage`, `FSListTile`, and `FSUserAvatar` from other packages (`core_ui`, `solution_lib`) suggests a consistent design system is being employed.
