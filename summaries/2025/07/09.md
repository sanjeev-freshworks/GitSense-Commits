# Activity Summary for 7/9/2025

## 3:23:38 AM
The log shows several code changes across multiple files within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, primarily focusing on the `solution` feature and its interaction with a common business library.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/common_business.dart` file was updated on 7/8/2025 at 6:05:26 PM. This file acts as an export hub for various Dart files related to data sources, mappers, models, repositories, dependency injection, domain use cases, and helper functions.  A significant portion of the update involves adding or modifying code related to data handling for attachments, Freddy (likely a translation/language processing service), and solution articles/categories.

Between 7/8/2025 6:05:47 PM and 7/8/2025 6:08:26 PM, multiple changes were made to files related to the `GetSolutionSubfoldersAndArticlesUseCase`.  The use case itself (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/usecase/get_solution_subfolders_and_articles_use_case.dart`) was modified, adding input validation to ensure the `page` parameter is greater than 0.  A corresponding parameter class (`GetSolutionSubfoldersAndArticlesUseCaseParam`) was also added/modified.  Dependency injection for this use case was updated in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/di/solution_domain_module.dart` at 6:06:37 PM.  Finally, a test file (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/domain/usecase/get_solution_subfolders_and_articles_use_case_test.dart`) and a helper file for test I/O (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/domain/helper/get_solution_subfolders_and_articles_expected_io.dart`) were created and subsequently modified multiple times (at 6:07:36 PM, 6:07:47 PM, 6:08:07 PM) refining test data, specifically adjusting `ArticleStatus` from `published` to `active`. The test file contains tests for various scenarios, including success cases with different valid page numbers and failure cases with invalid page numbers (0 or negative).

The `InvalidPageException` class in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/data/exception/invalid_page_exception.dart` was added at 6:28:29 PM and remains unchanged afterwards. This custom exception is thrown by the `GetSolutionSubfoldersAndArticlesUseCase` when an invalid page number is provided.

Further updates to the `GetSolutionSubfoldersAndArticlesUseCase` and its associated files occurred around 7/8/2025 6:29 PM, mainly involving adjustments to the parameter class, refactoring comments, and cleaning up the code structure. There were multiple near-identical commits within a short time-span.


Later updates (around 6:34 PM onwards) focus on enhancing the test cases for `GetSolutionSubfoldersAndArticlesUseCase`, improving test data with more realistic values and detailed structure. The test helper file undergoes substantial revisions, evolving from simple success/failure examples to more detailed scenarios, including testing with page 2 and handling various Article statuses.  This was followed by refinements to the testing around 7:14 PM, changing from simpler to more complex data structures, including `ExternalArticleModel`.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/solution_subfolders_and_articles_api_model.g.dart` (7/8/2025, 6:50:05 PM) shows generated code, likely from a JSON serialization library. This suggests automated code generation is used within the project.


Finally, around 7:19 PM the tests are significantly restructured, with changes reflecting the use of a `DI_MODULE` testing approach and incorporating more robust verification of response structures.  The `perPage` value in `GetSolutionSubfoldersAndArticlesQuery` is updated to 30 to match mock server configuration in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/usecase/get_solution_subfolders_and_articles_use_case.dart`.  A `SolutionRepositoryImpl` class is added (7/8/2025, 7:25:08 PM), suggesting a new implementation of the Solution Repository using a remote data source.

In summary, the log demonstrates an iterative development process focusing on the `GetSolutionSubfoldersAndArticlesUseCase`, with a substantial effort placed on thorough testing, utilizing the DI_MODULE approach, and ensuring the use case interacts properly with the underlying data layer and handles errors effectively.  The changes show movement towards more robust testing with realistic data.
