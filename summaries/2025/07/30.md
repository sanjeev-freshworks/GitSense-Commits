# Activity Summary for 7/30/2025

## 8:12:49 AM
The code changes primarily involve the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory, specifically focusing on the `folder_detail` feature.  Several files were updated between 7/29/2025, 6:07 PM and 7:55 PM.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/article_item_widget.dart`: Two nearly identical commits modified this file within a minute of each other (7/29/2025, 6:07 PM and 7/29/2025, 6:08 PM). The second commit changed the constructor to `const` and made some parameters `required`.  These changes are minor and primarily related to widget construction. A later commit at 7/29/2025, 7:15 PM adjusted the spacing of the `Icon` widget in `_buildViewsCountView`.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/model/article_ui_model.dart`: This file was updated at 7/29/2025, 6:09 PM. The change involved creating a `freezed` class for `ArticleUiModel`, defining its structure and fields.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/mapper/folder_detail_ui_mapper.dart`: This mapper underwent significant changes between 7/29/2025, 6:10 PM and 7:32 PM, across multiple commits. Key changes include:

*   Handling of `null` and empty values for `authorName`, `modifiedAt`, and `externalUrl` in various model mappings.
*   Improved error handling, particularly regarding `canLaunchUrl` and URL parsing for external articles.  The function `_getExternalArticleUri`  was extensively refactored to improve robustness.
*   The addition of error handling for null external URLs, resulting in a `UserMessage` being set to notify the user.
*   The `getStatusName` function was renamed to `_getStatusName`.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/folder_detail_screen.dart`:  This file was updated at 7/29/2025, 6:17 PM and again at 7/29/2025, 6:53 PM and 7/29/2025, 6:57 PM. The changes show the addition of a `FolderDetailNavigationStateOpenFolderInfoBottomSheet` case to handle opening a bottom sheet, likely for displaying more detailed folder information.  This was accompanied by modifications to handle and display `UserMessage` instances in the UI, indicating a new way of presenting error messages to the user. The initial modifications simplified the external URL handling in the `_listenState` method.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/model/folder_detail_event.dart`:  This file was updated at 7/29/2025, 6:42 PM.  The changes added events related to the newly introduced bottom sheet for folder information (`FolderDetailEventFolderInfoClicked`).

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/bloc/folder_detail_bloc.dart`: This bloc was updated multiple times between 7/29/2025, 6:45 PM and 7:27 PM.  The main changes were:

*   Removal of the `GetSolutionFolderInfoUseCase` dependency, simplifying the Bloc's dependencies.
*   Addition of error handling for `externalArticleUIModel.externalUrl == null` condition, displaying a user message if the URL is missing. This was improved in several commits to handle null URLs gracefully.
*   The `_onFolderInfoClicked` event handler was removed, likely due to the refactoring of folder info handling elsewhere.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/model/folder_detail_state.dart`: This file was modified at 7/29/2025, 6:51 PM and 7/29/2025, 6:54 PM, and 7/29/2025, 6:56 PM. The `userMessage` field was added and later removed from `FolderDetailStateContent`, suggesting a change in how error messages are managed.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/ui/mapper/folder_detail_ui_mapper_test.dart`:  The test file was updated between 7/29/2025, 7:32 PM and 7:55 PM to reflect the changes in the `folder_detail_ui_mapper.dart` file, adding tests for empty and invalid URLs. The tests were improved to handle the new `null` and empty URL scenarios.  The testing approach for external URLs was also altered to account for the inability of `url_launcher` to function in a testing environment.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/ui/bloc/folder_detail_bloc_test.dart`:  This test file was updated at 7/29/2025, 7:48 PM and subsequently refined to match the updated `folder_detail_bloc.dart` file's functionality, adding test cases for handling `null` external URLs, resulting in error messages.


The overall pattern suggests a focused effort on improving the robustness and error handling of the `folder_detail` feature, particularly concerning external article URLs and user experience.  The use of `freezed` and `Bloc` pattern is consistently employed throughout the codebase.


## 12:35:55 PM
The log shows several code changes across multiple files within the `Freshservice` mobile application's solution feature.  The most significant changes revolve around the `FolderDetailBloc` and related files.

Between 10:43 AM and 10:44 AM, the `article_detail_response_api_model_mapper.dart` file underwent two nearly identical commits. These commits appear to be minor adjustments or accidental double commits, as the code remains unchanged between the two timestamps.  The file's purpose is mapping API responses to data models for article details, handling null values gracefully.

A more substantial update happened at 11:11 AM to 11:12 PM in `folder_detail_bloc.dart`. This involved significant additions and modifications to the `FolderDetailBloc`, a Flutter Bloc managing the UI for a folder detail screen.  Key additions include event handling for article and folder item clicks, navigation handling, loading articles with pagination, error handling, and fetching folder information. There was a merge conflict involving a  handling of null `externalUrl`  which is addressed in this update. The bloc extensively uses use cases (`GetSolutionSubfoldersAndArticlesUseCase`, `GetSolutionFolderInfoUseCase`) for data fetching.

At 11:12 AM, `folder_detail_state.dart` was updated, introducing a `FolderDetailState` class using Freezed for managing different states of the folder detail screen (loading, content, and error states),including UI message management.

The `get_solution_folder_info_expected_io.dart` file (test helper) was modified multiple times between 11:22 AM and 11:23 AM. These commits involved changes to the expected output of the `GetSolutionFolderInfoUseCase`, particularly regarding folder visibility (`FolderVisibility`) and category name.  These changes likely reflect adjustments to test data for various scenarios.

The `folder_detail_bloc_test.dart` file (unit test) shows extensive testing of the `FolderDetailBloc` across multiple events (ViewCreated, NavigationHandled, LoadItems, ArticleItemClicked, FolderItemClicked, and ExternalArticleItemClicked) with thorough handling of success, error, and edge cases (empty results).  Several commits between 11:39 AM and 11:47 AM indicate iterative improvements or additions to these tests.


Finally, the `get_solution_article_detail_use_case_test.dart` file (unit test) contains a single, skipped test case for `get_solution_article_detail_use_case_success`.  The `skip` attribute and subsequent commit messages indicate a dependency on a pull request (`https://github.com/freshworks/mobile_flutter_freshservice/pull/817`) that hasn't yet been merged. The `skip` was eventually removed.

The `solution_ui_module.dart` file at 12:23 PM shows registrations of various UI-related components for dependency injection, including mappers and blocs related to the solution feature.

Lastly, updates to `intl_en.arb` at 12:25 PM involve adding or modifying localized strings, specifically around folder and article counts, view counts, and status labels.  There was a minor merge conflict around the "draft" string that's resolved.


## 1:39:46 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/article_detail_response_api_model_mapper.dart` between 12:49 PM and 12:51 PM on July 30, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on refining the null check within the `toDataModel()` method of the `ArticleResponseApiModelMapper` extension.  Initially, the check was `if (article?.id == null)`, then it evolved to `if (article != null && article?.id == null)`, and finally to `if (article == null && article?.id == null)` and `if (article != null && article.id == null)`. This suggests a debugging process aimed at correctly handling cases where the `article` object might be null.  The final change also adjusted the access to `article`'s properties like title and description within the ArticleDetailModel instantiation.

The code itself maps data from an `ArticleDetailResponseApiModel` to an `ArticleDetailModel`. It handles nested objects like `attachments`, `cloudAttachments`, and `articleLanguages`, and uses null-aware operators (`??`) to provide default values for optional fields.  The `AuthorResponseApiModelMapper` provides a simple mapping for author names.

A separate file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/res/common_ui_images.dart`, was updated at 1:28:19 PM on July 30, 2025. This file defines a collection of SVG images used in the UI, likely for icons, using the `FSLocalImageInfo` class.  Each image is defined with its asset name, package, and format.


## 2:42:05 PM
The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/categories/view/channel_test_screen.dart` underwent several modifications between 2:06 PM and 2:09 PM on July 30, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes was the implementation of a method channel ('com.example.channel') for communication between Flutter and native code.

Initially, the screen displayed a simple `Placeholder`.  The code then evolved to include a `MethodChannel`,  displaying a string variable  `_text` ("Default text") on the screen.  Subsequent changes added an `initState` method, setting up a method call handler for the channel. This handler updates the `_text` variable and triggers a `setState` rebuild when a method named 'updateText' is called from the native side, passing a new string as an argument. Finally, the text's style was updated to use the application's theme, leveraging the `core_ui` package.  The changes show a clear progression from a placeholder screen to a functional screen capable of receiving updates from a native platform.
