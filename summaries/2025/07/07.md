# Activity Summary for 7/7/2025

## 6:43:58 PM
The log shows modifications to data models and mappers related to solution subfolders and articles within a Flutter application.  The primary focus is on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/` directory.

The file `solution_subfolders_and_articles_meta_response_mapper.dart` underwent several revisions between 5:41 PM and 5:42 PM on July 7th, 2025.  These changes primarily centered around how null values were handled in the mapping process from an API response model (`SolutionSubfoldersAndArticlesMetaResponseApiModel`) to a data model (`SolutionSubfoldersAndArticlesMeta`). Initially, null values caused errors;  intermediate versions added default values (1) for null fields. The final version removed the default values, implying either server-side changes guaranteeing non-null values or a decision to handle nulls elsewhere in the application.

Around 5:42 PM on July 7th, 2025,  `solution_subfolders_and_articles_meta.dart` was updated. This update likely involved using the `freezed` package for generating immutable data classes, improving code maintainability and predictability.

Finally, `solution_subfolders_and_articles.dart` was modified twice around 5:49 PM on July 7th, 2025. These changes, however, appear to be identical, suggesting a potential accidental duplicate commit.  This file also uses the `freezed` package and defines a data class to represent solution subfolders and articles, including a list of entities and metadata (`FolderModel`).
