# Activity Summary for 7/7/2025

## 6:43:58 PM
The log shows modifications to data models and mappers related to solution subfolders and articles within a Flutter application.  The primary focus is on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/` directory.

The file `solution_subfolders_and_articles_meta_response_mapper.dart` underwent several revisions between 5:41 PM and 5:42 PM on July 7th, 2025.  These changes primarily centered around how null values were handled in the mapping process from an API response model (`SolutionSubfoldersAndArticlesMetaResponseApiModel`) to a data model (`SolutionSubfoldersAndArticlesMeta`). Initially, null values caused errors;  intermediate versions added default values (1) for null fields. The final version removed the default values, implying either server-side changes guaranteeing non-null values or a decision to handle nulls elsewhere in the application.

Around 5:42 PM on July 7th, 2025,  `solution_subfolders_and_articles_meta.dart` was updated. This update likely involved using the `freezed` package for generating immutable data classes, improving code maintainability and predictability.

Finally, `solution_subfolders_and_articles.dart` was modified twice around 5:49 PM on July 7th, 2025. These changes, however, appear to be identical, suggesting a potential accidental duplicate commit.  This file also uses the `freezed` package and defines a data class to represent solution subfolders and articles, including a list of entities and metadata (`FolderModel`).


## 10:06:01 PM
The log shows a series of code changes related to the development of a "solution" feature within a Flutter Freshservice mobile application.  The primary focus is on data layer code generation, specifically for retrieving subfolders and articles.

Between 6:47 PM and 6:54 PM, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md` file was repeatedly updated with minor revisions to the prompt's instructions. These minor edits primarily clarified the expected data model usage (`folder_list_model` or `FolderModel`), emphasizing the use of  `subfolders_and_articles` instead of `entity` or `entities` in naming conventions.  The core prompt remained consistent:  generating data layer code for fetching subfolders and articles from a `/api/_/solutions/entities` endpoint, using query parameters `page`, `per_page`, and `folder_id`.  The code should utilize `@JsonSerializable` for API models and `@freezed` for data models.

Starting at approximately 6:50 PM, several files within the `libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib` directory were created or updated.  This directory was later refactored into `features/solution` (around 6:54 PM).  The changes include:

* **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/solution_remote_constants.dart`**: This file was repeatedly updated (6:50 PM - 6:51 PM) without changes to its content, indicating potential version control or synchronization issues. It defines constants for API paths and parameters related to the solution API. This file was later moved to `features/solution` and extended to include additional API paths (`solutionCategoriesPath`, `solutionFoldersPath`).

* **Data Models and Mappers (6:51 PM - 6:57 PM):** Several files were added in the `features/solution` directory defining data models (`solution_subfolders_and_articles.dart`, `solution_entity.dart`, `solution_meta.dart`) using the `freezed` library and API models (`solution_subfolders_and_articles_api_model.dart`, `solution_entity_api_model.dart`, `solution_meta_api_model.dart`) using `json_annotation`.  Associated mapper classes were also created to handle transformations between API and data models.

* **Remote Data Source (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/solution_remote_data_source.dart` then moved to `features/solution`):** This file (updated around 6:53 PM) defines a `SolutionRemoteDataSource` class responsible for making API calls to fetch subfolders and articles, using the defined constants and mappers.  The file also underwent minor updates to the `successParser` to explicitly type-cast the JSON response. The final version of this file in `features/solution` extends its functionality to include methods for fetching solution categories and folders.

* **Repository (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/repository/solution_repository.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/repository/impl/solution_repository_impl.dart`):**  An abstract `SolutionRepository` interface and its implementation (`SolutionRepositoryImpl`) were created (around 6:58 PM) to encapsulate the data access logic.  The repository exposes methods to fetch solution categories, folders, and subfolders/articles.  The implementation utilizes the `SolutionRemoteDataSource`.


In summary, the log details the iterative development of the data layer for a "solution" feature, involving multiple data models, API models, mappers, a remote data source, and a repository.  The time period of most significant changes spans from approximately 6:50 PM to 7:01 PM, reflecting the creation and refinement of core data layer components.  Repeated updates to the `solution_remote_constants.dart`  file before 6:51 PM suggest a potential issue with version control or build process.
