# Activity Summary for 7/2/2025

## 12:31:46 PM
The log shows a series of code changes related to the `solution` feature in a Flutter application, primarily focusing on data models and use cases for fetching solution folders.

Between 11:39 AM and 11:51 AM, several iterations of  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/solution_folder_response_api_model.dart`  were made, refining the `SolutionFolderResponseApiModel` class.  The most significant change was the removal of the `approvalSettings` field.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/solution_folder_meta_response_api_model.dart`  was updated once at 11:39:01 AM, defining the `SolutionFolderMetaResponseApiModel`.


Multiple revisions of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/request/solution_folders_query.dart` occurred between 11:41 AM and 11:44 AM,  with the class name fluctuating between `SolutionFoldersRequestModel` and `SolutionFoldersQuery` before settling on `SolutionFoldersQuery`.

The `SolutionFolder` data model  (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/solution_folder.dart`) underwent several modifications between 11:43 AM and 11:49 AM, primarily concerning the `hasSubfolders` and `manageByGroupIds` fields, changing their nullability and types.

Mapper classes,  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/solution_folder_response_api_model_mapper.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/solution_folder_meta_response_api_model_mapper.dart`, were also updated to handle the changes in the API response models. The `solution_folder_meta_response_api_model_mapper.dart` file saw multiple revisions refining the handling of `perPage`.

Finally, the `GetSolutionFoldersUseCase` file (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/usecase/get_solution_folders_use_case.dart`) was significantly revised between 12:27 PM and 12:29 PM, evolving from an empty class to a fully functional use case that interacts with a `SolutionRepository`.  The method name was also changed from `call` to `protectedExecute`. A test file  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/usecase/get_solution_folders_use_case_test.dart`  was created, though it remains empty.

In summary, the log documents the development and refinement of data models for solution folders, their mappers, and a use case for retrieving them.  The most active period of development was between 11:39 AM and 11:49 AM and 12:27 PM to 12:29 PM.  There was noticeable inconsistency in naming conventions and field definitions, which were largely resolved.


## 1:48:07 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory, specifically within the unit testing suite for a `get_solution_folders_use_case`.  The modifications span from 12:32 PM to 1:23 PM on July 2nd, 2025.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/usecase/get_solution_folders_use_case_test.dart` file underwent several import changes,  starting with just the solution package, gradually adding `test`, and then `core`.  The most significant change in this file was at 1:11 PM when the DI module import changed from `solution_di_module` to `solution_di_module.dart` and the test setup began using `SolutionDIModuleTest.register()`.

The  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/usecase/helper/get_solution_folders_expected_io.dart` file shows the most extensive evolution.  Initially empty, it was populated with test data for successful scenarios. The data structure for input and output changed substantially over several commits (between 12:35 PM and 1:23 PM), refining the `SolutionFoldersQuery` input and `SolutionFolders` output,  adding a `SolutionFolderMeta` class, and including more detailed and realistic `SolutionFolder` objects including fields like `visibility`, `defaultFolder`, `hasSubfolders`, `manageByGroupIds`, `categoryName`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`. The `description` field was initially omitted but was added later. The final `perPage` value was changed from 30 to 300 at 1:23 PM. Also, at 1:20 PM there was an attempt to return a `UCSuccessResult` from the success method, that was later removed.

The `SolutionDIModule` and `SolutionModule` files were created later in the sequence (around 1:06 PM and 1:07 PM), reflecting the setup of the dependency injection for the solution feature, registering data and domain modules by 1:14 PM.


The overall pattern indicates a phased development of unit tests for the `get_solution_folders_use_case`. This included initial setup, iterative refinement of expected input/output data to reflect the actual API response, and the implementation of a proper dependency injection module.  The final commit to `get_solution_folders_expected_io.dart` (1:23 PM) represents a complete and realistic test data set.
