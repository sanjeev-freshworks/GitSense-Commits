# Activity Summary for 7/2/2025

## 12:31:46 PM
The log shows a series of code changes related to the `solution` feature in a Flutter application, primarily focusing on data models and use cases for fetching solution folders.

Between 11:39 AM and 11:51 AM, several iterations of  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/solution_folder_response_api_model.dart`  were made, refining the `SolutionFolderResponseApiModel` class.  The most significant change was the removal of the `approvalSettings` field.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/solution_folder_meta_response_api_model.dart`  was updated once at 11:39:01 AM, defining the `SolutionFolderMetaResponseApiModel`.


Multiple revisions of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/request/solution_folders_query.dart` occurred between 11:41 AM and 11:44 AM,  with the class name fluctuating between `SolutionFoldersRequestModel` and `SolutionFoldersQuery` before settling on `SolutionFoldersQuery`.

The `SolutionFolder` data model  (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/solution_folder.dart`) underwent several modifications between 11:43 AM and 11:49 AM, primarily concerning the `hasSubfolders` and `manageByGroupIds` fields, changing their nullability and types.

Mapper classes,  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/solution_folder_response_api_model_mapper.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/solution_folder_meta_response_api_model_mapper.dart`, were also updated to handle the changes in the API response models. The `solution_folder_meta_response_api_model_mapper.dart` file saw multiple revisions refining the handling of `perPage`.

Finally, the `GetSolutionFoldersUseCase` file (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/usecase/get_solution_folders_use_case.dart`) was significantly revised between 12:27 PM and 12:29 PM, evolving from an empty class to a fully functional use case that interacts with a `SolutionRepository`.  The method name was also changed from `call` to `protectedExecute`. A test file  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/usecase/get_solution_folders_use_case_test.dart`  was created, though it remains empty.

In summary, the log documents the development and refinement of data models for solution folders, their mappers, and a use case for retrieving them.  The most active period of development was between 11:39 AM and 11:49 AM and 12:27 PM to 12:29 PM.  There was noticeable inconsistency in naming conventions and field definitions, which were largely resolved.


## 1:48:07 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory, specifically within the unit testing suite for a `get_solution_folders_use_case`.  The modifications span from 12:32 PM to 1:23 PM on July 2nd, 2025.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/usecase/get_solution_folders_use_case_test.dart` file underwent several import changes,  starting with just the solution package, gradually adding `test`, and then `core`.  The most significant change in this file was at 1:11 PM when the DI module import changed from `solution_di_module` to `solution_di_module.dart` and the test setup began using `SolutionDIModuleTest.register()`.

The  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/usecase/helper/get_solution_folders_expected_io.dart` file shows the most extensive evolution.  Initially empty, it was populated with test data for successful scenarios. The data structure for input and output changed substantially over several commits (between 12:35 PM and 1:23 PM), refining the `SolutionFoldersQuery` input and `SolutionFolders` output,  adding a `SolutionFolderMeta` class, and including more detailed and realistic `SolutionFolder` objects including fields like `visibility`, `defaultFolder`, `hasSubfolders`, `manageByGroupIds`, `categoryName`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`. The `description` field was initially omitted but was added later. The final `perPage` value was changed from 30 to 300 at 1:23 PM. Also, at 1:20 PM there was an attempt to return a `UCSuccessResult` from the success method, that was later removed.

The `SolutionDIModule` and `SolutionModule` files were created later in the sequence (around 1:06 PM and 1:07 PM), reflecting the setup of the dependency injection for the solution feature, registering data and domain modules by 1:14 PM.


The overall pattern indicates a phased development of unit tests for the `get_solution_folders_use_case`. This included initial setup, iterative refinement of expected input/output data to reflect the actual API response, and the implementation of a proper dependency injection module.  The final commit to `get_solution_folders_expected_io.dart` (1:23 PM) represents a complete and realistic test data set.


## 2:48:04 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `solution` feature of a Flutter application.  Early changes (between 1:54 PM and 1:55 PM) involved refinements to the `get_solution_folders_expected_io.dart` test file, iteratively modifying the `success` function's output to use `const` constructors for improved code efficiency and consistency.

Between 1:57 PM and 1:58 PM, the `solution_remote_data_source.dart` file underwent several revisions.  These modifications likely centered around import statements, potentially addressing dependency conflicts by explicitly excluding `SolutionFoldersResponseApiModel` from the `common_business` library imports.  The core functionality of the `getSolutionCategories` and `getSolutionFolders` methods remained consistent.


Subsequently, between 2:34 PM and 2:41 PM, there's a substantial series of edits to `sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md`. This file appears to be a template or instruction file for code generation, specifically for a data layer.  The repeated modifications suggest iterative refinement of the instructions for code generation, altering aspects like:

* **Module Name:** Initially set to `approval_lib`, and later changed to `solution` or `solution_lib`.
* **API Information Source:** Multiple attempts were made to correctly specify the location of API information and response samples,  indicating some initial difficulty in finding the correct paths.
* **Query Parameters:**  The `approval_filter` parameter was initially specified, later replaced by  `folder_id`.
* **Enums:** The `priority` enum was initially specified, later replaced by `type`.
* **Target Function:** The function being specified shifted from `Requester Approval List` to `Get Subfolders and Articles`.
* **File Names:** There were corrections in file names specified in the instructions, particularly the data source and repository files.

Finally, there were changes (2:45 PM and 2:46 PM) in `solution_remote_constants.dart` in the `approval_lib` library.  These changes seem minor, possibly just formatting changes or initial commit to the file.  The final prompt file (2:47 PM) reflects the corrected information for generating the `solution` data layer code, which includes the final `solution_remote_constants.dart` file paths and expected file names.  The overall pattern highlights an iterative process of defining and refining the specifications for automated code generation of the data layer of the `solution` feature.


## 3:48:06 PM
The log shows several modifications across multiple Dart files within the `features/solution` directory of a Flutter project.  The changes primarily focus on data models and API interactions related to solutions, folders, and entities.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/solution_remote_constants.dart` underwent multiple revisions between 2:49:04 PM and 2:49:34 PM, but the content remained unchanged.  This suggests potential auto-save or version control operations rather than actual code alterations.

At 2:49:44 PM,  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/request/solution_entities_query.dart` was updated. This file defines a data model (`SolutionEntitiesQuery`) for querying solution entities, using `freezed_annotation` for code generation.

Subsequent updates at 2:50:08 PM and 2:50:30 PM modified `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/solution_entity_type.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/solution_entities_response_api_model.dart` respectively.  These files deal with the structure of responses received from API calls related to solutions, utilizing `freezed_annotation` for data class generation.  The `SolutionEntitiesResponseApiModel` appears to be a comprehensive model, encompassing details like entity type, IDs, timestamps, and metadata.

At 2:50:49 PM, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/solution_entities.dart` was updated to define data models for `SolutionEntities`, `SolutionEntity`, `SolutionAuthor`, and `SolutionEntitiesMeta`, also using `freezed_annotation`.  These models appear to be the data structures used to represent solution entities within the application.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/solution_entities_response_api_model_mapper.dart` was modified twice, at 2:51:04 PM and 2:51:39 PM.  This file contains extension methods to map data from the API response models (`SolutionEntitiesResponseApiModel`, `SolutionEntityApiModel`, `SolutionAuthorApiModel`, `SolutionEntitiesMetaApiModel`) to the application's data models.  The second revision appears to refine the mapping by explicitly using `this` keyword for accessing member variables.

Finally, the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/solution_folder.dart` underwent multiple revisions between 2:52:38 PM and 2:56:41 PM. The main change was making `description` and `name` fields required within `SolutionFolder` data class.  The numerous revisions suggest iterative development or refinement of this model.  At 2:56:54 PM, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/repository/solution_repository.dart` was updated, defining an interface for a `SolutionRepository` which suggests an abstraction for accessing solution-related data.

In summary, the code changes reflect a focused effort on refining data models for handling solution information, particularly the mapping between API responses and application-specific data structures.  The use of `freezed_annotation` is a recurring element, indicating a preference for immutable data models.  The multiple revisions of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/solution_folder.dart` and the initial unchanged revisions of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/solution_remote_constants.dart` might indicate a work-in-progress, iterative development cycle.


## 4:48:01 PM
The log shows three revisions of the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/solution_entities_response_api_model.dart`.  The file defines Dart classes (`SolutionEntitiesResponseApiModel`, `SolutionEntityApiModel`, `SolutionAuthorApiModel`, `SolutionEntitiesMetaApiModel`) using the `json_annotation` package for JSON serialization.  No changes were made to the code's structure or content across the three revisions at 3:51:19 PM, 3:51:35 PM, and 4:44:32 PM.  The only difference is the timestamp, suggesting that multiple saves of an unchanged file occurred within a short period.  All three versions contain the same classes, their fields, and their JSON serialization/deserialization methods.


## 5:48:06 PM
The log shows several code changes across multiple Dart files within a Flutter project, focusing on a "solution" feature.  The most significant changes occur between 5:41 PM and 5:43 PM.

`/Users/skumar14/.zshrc`: This file, a Zsh configuration file, was modified twice, with a four-minute gap, at approximately 5:26 PM and 5:30 PM.  The changes do not appear in the provided diffs; the content remains identical in both entries.  The file sets up the environment with configurations for Oh My Zsh, Android SDK, Go, and other tools, including setting aliases and defining environment variables for various development tools.  Note that some sensitive information (like keys and passwords) are present in this file and have not been included in the summary as requested.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/solution_remote_constants.dart`: This file, containing constants for remote API calls, saw multiple updates between 5:41 PM and 5:42 PM.  The main change was the addition of `solutionFoldersPath` constant alongside `solutionCategoriesPath`.  There's a merge conflict evident in the commit history shown by the HEAD and 4f98600... hash. The final version includes both constants.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/solution_remote_data_source.dart`: This Dart file, which defines the remote data source for solutions, also underwent multiple revisions between 5:42 PM and 5:43 PM. These revisions show merge conflicts resolved, and ultimately reflect the addition of a new function `getSolutionFolders`  to fetch solution folders, using the newly added constants from `solution_remote_constants.dart`.  The imports also show minor changes resolved during the merge.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/di/solution_data_module.dart`: This file, responsible for dependency injection, was updated at 5:43 PM. The update registers the `SolutionRemoteDataSource` and `SolutionRepositoryImpl`.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/repository/impl/solution_repository_impl.dart`:  This file, which implements the solution repository, was modified several times between 5:44 PM and 5:45 PM.  One change includes adding and then removing a seemingly unnecessary `interface` member and an assignment operator overload. The final version is identical to the one before the addition of this extraneous code.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/repository/solution_repository.dart`: This file, defining the solution repository interface, was updated at 5:44 PM to add an abstract interface keyword.

In summary, the code changes primarily focus on adding functionality to retrieve solution folders from a remote API.  There were merge conflicts resolved in the process which involved the `solution_remote_data_source.dart` and `solution_remote_constants.dart` files. The addition of the `getSolutionFolders` functionality to fetch solution folders, which depends on newly added API endpoints in `solution_remote_constants.dart`, is the core modification across the related files.  The dependency injection and repository implementation files were adjusted to accommodate this new functionality.  The changes to `.zshrc` appear unrelated to the other modifications in the log.


## 6:48:02 PM
The log shows modifications across several files.  Initially, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/settings.json` file was updated twice within a minute (6:31 PM). These changes involved adding Copilot Buddy task definitions and configuring test generation instructions using a `.copilot-test-instructions.md` file. The tasks focused on various aspects of data model, API model, and use case generation.

Subsequently, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md` file underwent multiple revisions between 6:32 PM and 6:37 PM.  These revisions refined the prompt instructions for code generation.  The core functionality remained consistent—generating data layer code for a "solution" module based on specified API information from `freshservice_mobile_api_mock`. The main change in these revisions was iteratively refining the naming conventions for generated files and classes to avoid using "entity" or "entities" and instead use more descriptive names like "subfolders_and_articles".

Finally, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/solution_remote_constants.dart` file was updated multiple times between 6:46 PM and 6:47 PM. These changes appear to be minor and did not alter the content of the `SolutionRemoteConstants` class, suggesting possible accidental repeated saves.  The class defines constants for various solution API paths and parameters.
