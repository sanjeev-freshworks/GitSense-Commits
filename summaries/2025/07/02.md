# Activity Summary for 7/2/2025

## 12:31:46 PM
The log shows a series of code changes related to the `solution` feature in a Flutter application, primarily focusing on data models and use cases for fetching solution folders.

Between 11:39 AM and 11:51 AM, several iterations of  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/solution_folder_response_api_model.dart`  were made, refining the `SolutionFolderResponseApiModel` class.  The most significant change was the removal of the `approvalSettings` field.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/solution_folder_meta_response_api_model.dart`  was updated once at 11:39:01 AM, defining the `SolutionFolderMetaResponseApiModel`.


Multiple revisions of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/request/solution_folders_query.dart` occurred between 11:41 AM and 11:44 AM,  with the class name fluctuating between `SolutionFoldersRequestModel` and `SolutionFoldersQuery` before settling on `SolutionFoldersQuery`.

The `SolutionFolder` data model  (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/solution_folder.dart`) underwent several modifications between 11:43 AM and 11:49 AM, primarily concerning the `hasSubfolders` and `manageByGroupIds` fields, changing their nullability and types.

Mapper classes,  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/solution_folder_response_api_model_mapper.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/solution_folder_meta_response_api_model_mapper.dart`, were also updated to handle the changes in the API response models. The `solution_folder_meta_response_api_model_mapper.dart` file saw multiple revisions refining the handling of `perPage`.

Finally, the `GetSolutionFoldersUseCase` file (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/usecase/get_solution_folders_use_case.dart`) was significantly revised between 12:27 PM and 12:29 PM, evolving from an empty class to a fully functional use case that interacts with a `SolutionRepository`.  The method name was also changed from `call` to `protectedExecute`. A test file  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/usecase/get_solution_folders_use_case_test.dart`  was created, though it remains empty.

In summary, the log documents the development and refinement of data models for solution folders, their mappers, and a use case for retrieving them.  The most active period of development was between 11:39 AM and 11:49 AM and 12:27 PM to 12:29 PM.  There was noticeable inconsistency in naming conventions and field definitions, which were largely resolved.
