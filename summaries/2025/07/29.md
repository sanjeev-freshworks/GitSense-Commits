# Activity Summary for 7/29/2025

## 3:59:58 AM
The log shows a single code change on July 28th, 2025, at 11:04:03 PM, affecting the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/presentation/mapper/article_info_ui_model_mapper.dart`.  This file contains a Dart class `ArticleInfoUiModelMapper` which maps data from an `ArticleDetailModel` to an `ArticleInfoUIModel`.  The mapper uses several use cases (`GetBootstrapAccountUseCase`, `FormatDateUseCase`) and relies on localization (`SolutionLibLocalizations`) for handling display of article status.  The mapping includes transforming creation date using `_formatDateUseCase`, handling potential null values using `SolutionPresentationConstants.defaultLabelValue`, and retrieving workspace name using the result of `_getBootstrapAccountUseCase`.  The code showcases dependency injection through constructor parameters for the use cases.


## 1:28:05 PM
The log shows several code changes related to an article detail feature in a Flutter application.  The most significant updates occurred between 12:50 PM and 12:53 PM on July 29, 2025, focusing on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/presentation/bloc/article_detail_bloc.dart` file. These changes involved enhancing the `ArticleDetailBloc` to handle various events, including loading article details, managing language selection, and displaying related information.  The bloc now uses mappers for converting data models for different UI components. The addition of `SolutionLibLocalizations` suggests internationalization support.

A corresponding change at 12:52 PM to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/presentation/model/article_detail_event.dart` introduced new events for handling user interactions like language selection and viewing article information. The `freezed` package indicates the use of immutable data structures.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/ui/bloc/article_detail_bloc_test.dart` (updated at 1:11 PM and 1:12 PM) contains unit tests for the `ArticleDetailBloc`, covering various scenarios including successful and failed API calls, and UI state changes.  These tests utilize mocking for dependencies like use cases and mappers.

Finally, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` file was updated twice (1:19 PM and 1:22 PM),  with only a minor syntax correction (adding a missing comma) to the English localization file.  This file defines localized strings for the application.  The changes are minor and related to the UI text strings.
