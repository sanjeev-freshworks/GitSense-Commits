# Activity Summary for 7/26/2025

## 2:12:23 AM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/user_lib` directory.  The updates center around data models and mappers related to a "BootstrapAccount."

The initial changes (around 9:55 PM and 9:57 PM) involve the creation and modification of data models (`workspace.dart`, `bootstrap_account_api_model_mapper.dart`).  `workspace.dart` defines a `WorkSpace` model with preferences, while `bootstrap_account_api_model_mapper.dart` introduces extensive extension methods for mapping between API models and data models for `BootstrapAccount`, `WorkSpace`, `WorkSpacePreferences`, and related entities. These mappers handle conversions between API responses and the application's internal data structures.

Subsequently (between 9:58 PM and 10:00 PM), several modifications were made to  `get_bootstrap_account_expected_result.dart`. This file appears to contain test data for a `GetBootstrapAccountUseCase`. The key changes here are additions and modifications to the `getWorkSpaceList()` function within the `GetBootstrapAccountExpectedIO` class.  This function populates a map of `WorkSpace` objects, with incremental changes seen between each commit: initially, only IDs were present in the keys, then names were added to the workspaces, and finally more workspace names like "IT2", "General", and "Finance" were introduced, suggesting a progressive refinement of test data to cover a wider range of workspace configurations.  The timestamps indicate these modifications happened within a short time span (around 2 minutes).  All other aspects of the `BootstrapAccount` (features, tempFeatures, etc) remain constant throughout these changes.


## 1:48:42 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, specifically within the `solution` module.  The main activity centers around  refining the `/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/solution/get_folder_info/success.json` file which contains mock JSON responses for a "Get Folder Info" API endpoint.

Initially, the `success.json` file contained two responses.  Response 1 represented a base case, while Response 2 demonstrated a change in the `visibility` field and group management (`group_ids` and `manage_by_group_ids`).  Subsequent updates added more responses, expanding the variety of mock data to include additional fields (e.g., `workspace_ids`, `department_ids`) and variations in their values.  The `updated_at` timestamps within the JSON responses reflect these changes over the time period of July 25th and 26th, 2025.  The most significant changes in the `success.json` file occurred between 1:08 PM and 1:09 PM on July 26th, 2025.

The majority of changes after 1:12 PM on July 26th, 2025, concern the generation of Dart code related to data layer using a prompt called `data_layer_codegen`. The promptâ€™s inputs were iteratively refined, primarily concerning the definition of the `visibility` enum in the response and specifying mandatory fields.  The output of this code generation are files related to data models (`folder_info_api_model.dart`, `folder_info_folder_api_model.dart`, etc.), data source (`solution_remote_data_source.dart`), repository (`solution_repository.dart`, `solution_repository_impl.dart`), mappers (`folder_info_api_model_mapper.dart`, etc.), and constants (`solution_remote_constants.dart`). The filepaths for these generated files are within the `features/solution/lib/src/data` directory.  There were numerous minor adjustments, primarily to ensure that the correct types are defined and null handling is implemented.  The final version of  `solution_remote_data_source.dart` includes multiple functions covering different solution-related API calls: `getSolutionCategories`, `getSolutionFolders`, `getSolutionSubfoldersAndArticles`, `searchSolutionArticles`, `getSolutionArticleDetail`, and `getFolderInfo`.  The `folder_info_folder_api_model.dart` file undergoes the most revisions, progressively simplifying the model by removing unnecessary fields and adjusting the types of fields like `manageByGroupIds`, `groupIds`, `workspaceIds`, and `departmentIds` to better reflect the needs of the application.  Between 1:29 PM and 1:34 PM on July 26th, 2025, the significant refactoring of the `folder_info_folder_api_model.dart` took place with the removal of redundant `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields and a clearer definition of data types for groups and departments.  The final changes consolidate related model definitions into a single file, improving the organization of the data layer code.


## 3:17:28 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/folder_info_api_model_mapper.dart` file between 1:48 PM and 2:08 PM on July 26, 2025.  These changes involved refining the mapping of API responses to data models for folder information.  The initial versions included multiple extension methods for different API model types.  Subsequent changes gradually simplified the code by consolidating the mappers and  handling null values more efficiently using the null-aware operator (`??`) and the `.nonNulls` extension.

A notable change around 1:58 PM involved switching the data source from using `id!` to `folder?.` to access nested properties within the API response model.  This points to a restructuring of the API response. The `_mapManageByGroups` function was significantly altered, changing its return type from a list of `FolderInfoManageByGroup` objects to a list of Strings. This suggests that the group IDs are now directly represented as strings in the API response, rather than requiring a separate mapper.  The final version uses only one `toDataModel` method to process the response.

Between 2:00 PM and 2:08 PM, the `_mapVisibility` function was modified to handle all cases, including a default "unknown" case, within the `_mapVisibility` function.  Also, the return types of the `_mapManageByGroups`, `FolderInfoDepartmentApiModelMapper`, and `FolderInfoManageByGroupApiModelMapper` were altered to be more consistent and efficient.

Finally, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/folder_info_api_model.dart` file was modified at 1:57 PM and 1:58 PM to remove the `id` field from the `FolderInfoFolderApiModel` class.

The changes in  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/usecase/get_folder_info_use_case.dart` between 2:11 PM and 2:13 PM show the evolution of a use case for retrieving folder information. Initially empty, it was then refined to become a `UseCase` that takes an integer (folder ID) as input and returns a `FolderInfo` object.  Further iterations improved the parameter handling and method naming (`call` changed to `protectedExecute`). The final version uses a custom parameter class `GetFolderInfoUseCaseParams` for improved clarity.

Lastly, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/di/solution_domain_module.dart` file shows the registration of the `GetFolderInfoUseCase` in the dependency injection module at 2:14 PM.  This is a standard dependency injection setup.  The `folder_info` data model was updated to use a freezed class to reflect the changes made to how data is retrieved from the API.


## 4:17:09 PM
The log shows development on the `mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, specifically focusing on the solution feature.  The primary changes revolve around the `get_folder_info_expected_io.dart` file,  `get_folder_info_use_case_test.dart` file, and the creation of several files related to the UI for displaying folder information.

Between 3:19 PM and 3:22 PM, `get_folder_info_expected_io.dart` underwent significant modifications.  Initially an empty class, it evolved to include a `success()` method that constructs a `FolderInfo` object. The `FolderInfo` object's data was refined iteratively, changing  `name`, `description`, `visibility` (using `FolderVisibility.loggedInUsers` which is later also used in testing) , `manageByGroups`, and `categoryName` based on data presumably obtained from `success.json` file.  The final version returns a tuple of input and output.

Concurrently, `success.json` was updated to reflect a more complete folder information structure.

From 3:23 PM to 3:44 PM, the `get_folder_info_use_case_test.dart` file was modified. Initially, a simple test was added to verify the `GetFolderInfoUseCase`. This test was then improved over several iterations, including changes to the `setUp` method, and the  `GetFolderInfoUseCase` object initialization. Finally, the test was made asynchronous (`async/await`).

Beginning around 3:39 PM, the `GetFolderInfoUseCase` was modified to accept `GetFolderInfoUseCaseParams` as input, requiring a `folderId`.  This was reflected in the test cases and `get_folder_info_expected_io.dart`, which now incorporates the use of  `UCResult`.

Between 3:50 PM and 3:53 PM, a test file (`folder_info_api_model_mapper_test.dart`) for mapping API responses to the data model was added with comprehensive tests for various scenarios including null values and different visibility types.


From 3:55 PM onwards, the focus shifted to the UI layer. New files were created for the UI model (`folder_info_ui_model.dart`), screen arguments (`folder_info_screen_args.dart`), and a mapper (`folder_info_ui_model_mapper.dart`).  `folder_info_ui_model.dart`  was extensively reworked, starting as a simple class and ending up as a `@freezed` class, and adding fields for articles and subfolders counts.  The  `folder_info_ui_model_mapper.dart` file was created and implemented to map between the data model and the UI model, resolving placeholder values and mapping folder visibility to readable text.  The `_formVisibiltyText` helper function, also added in this mapper, handles the translation of the `FolderVisibility` enum to user-friendly strings.  The `GetSolutionFolderInfoUseCase` was created as an alternative to the original `GetFolderInfoUseCase`.


In summary, the log tracks the development of a feature to fetch and display folder information. The changes followed a pattern of iterative refinement, starting with basic implementations and progressing to more robust and complete code including unit testing and error handling.  The development spans across several layers, from data access and mapping to UI presentation.


## 5:17:13 PM
The log shows code changes across two files: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_info/presentation/mapper/folder_info_ui_model_mapper.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb`.  The changes span approximately 30 minutes, from 4:17 PM to 5:16 PM on July 26th, 2025.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_info/presentation/mapper/folder_info_ui_model_mapper.dart`**: This file underwent significant changes related to the `FolderInfoUiModelMapper`. Initially, the `subfoldersCount` was a placeholder.  Later revisions introduced  `SolutionLibLocalizations` and `CommonUILocalizations` to handle visibility text, replacing placeholder values with localized strings for `allUsers`, `loggedInUsers`, and `allAgents`.  A `_getVisibiltyText` helper function was created to handle the visibility logic. The final change incorporated  `GetBootstrapAccountUseCase` dependency to fetch workspace names for  `agentsInSpecificWorkspaces` visibility, though this case remains unimplemented.  The input class was modified to include localization parameters and  made private member variables.


**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb`**: This file contains localization strings for the application.  The main updates involved adding new keys for different visibility options (`mangedBy`, `visibleTo`, `managedByGroupsInWorkspace`, `allUsers`, `loggedInUsers`, `agentsInWorkspace`, `agentsInWorkspaces`, `workspace`, `workspaces`). There were several intermediate commits with typos and incomplete entries before reaching the final version, which includes proper pluralization for workspace labels and detailed descriptions within the `@`-prefixed meta-data for many keys.  The `managedBy` key was eventually replaced by `managedByAllGroupsInWorkspace` and `managedBySpecificGroupsInWorkspace` to provide more specific localization options. The use of `[[Agents]]` suggests the use of a placeholder for a potentially styled string.


In summary, the changes reflect a refinement of the folder information mapping and the addition of comprehensive localization support for different visibility levels, including handling of plural forms and a dependency for workspace resolution in the mapper.  The majority of the updates to the `.arb` file happened in quick succession, indicating an iterative process to finalize the localization strings. The `folder_info_ui_model_mapper.dart` file also went through multiple refactorings, primarily to accommodate the new localization approach and the planned support for `agentsInSpecificWorkspaces`.


## 7:02:01 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/ui/mapper/folder_info_ui_model_mapper_test.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/testfixture/ui/folder_info/folder_info_ui_model_mapper_input_fixture.dart` between 6:04 PM and 6:50 PM on July 26, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on unit testing a `FolderInfoUiModelMapper`.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/ui/mapper/folder_info_ui_model_mapper_test.dart` file underwent several revisions.  Early versions (6:04 PM) included a `mockito.registerFallbackValue` line to handle potential `MissingDummyValueError` exceptions during testing. This line was subsequently removed in later commits (6:04:34 PM and onwards), with the dummy value being set up using `when(mockGetBootstrapAccountUseCase(any)) .thenAnswer(...)` instead. Further refactoring occurred, simplifying test setup and organization.  Finally the test structure changed to group tests by functionality (Visibility Mapping, Workspace Visibility, Managed By Text).

The  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/testfixture/ui/folder_info/folder_info_ui_model_mapper_input_fixture.dart` file was heavily modified to improve its structure and organization.  The initial version (6:29:25 PM) contained many individual methods for generating test inputs and expected outputs for different visibility scenarios.  Later commits (6:29:34 PM, 6:30:28 PM, 6:30:56 PM, 6:31:14 PM, 6:31:30 PM, 6:31:44 PM, 6:39:05 PM, 6:39:28 PM, 6:42:06 PM, 6:42:26 PM, 6:44:16 PM, 6:48:46 PM, 6:50:25 PM) progressively refactored the code. The refactoring aimed at reducing code duplication by introducing helper methods (`_createInput` and `_createExpected`) for generating input and expected output models, respectively.  The `expectedResult` methods were also changed to be functions returning `FolderInfoUiModel` instead of `const` values. The final version separates workspace-specific scenarios into their own methods for better readability.  Also, the `managedBy` field in the expected results was standardized to use "All groups in {categoryName} workspace", except in the specific case of `expectedWithManageByGroups`, which handles scenarios with specific group management. The visibility strings also received minor modifications for better consistency and clarity (e.g., removing redundant parentheses and adjusting capitalization). A new file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/testfixture/ui/folder_info/folder_info_ui_model_mapper_input_fixture_refactored.dart` was also created around 6:46 PM.

In summary, the changes reflect a focused effort to improve the testability, maintainability, and readability of the code through consistent refactoring, including improved error handling, test organization and better fixture management.


## 9:02:26 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/bloc/folder_detail_bloc.dart` file between 7:51 PM and 8:02 PM on July 26, 2025.  These changes primarily focus on the `FolderDetailBloc`, refining its functionality related to loading and handling folder details.

The initial changes involved adding event handling for various actions, including `FolderDetailEventViewCreated`, `FolderDetailEventLoadItems`, `FolderDetailEventNavigationHandled`, `FolderDetailEventArticleItemClicked`, `FolderDetailEventFolderItemClicked`, `FolderDetailEventExternalArticleItemClicked`, and `FolderDetailEventFolderInfoClicked`.  The `_onLoadItems` function was significantly developed, handling pagination and error states.  It fetches subfolders and articles using `_getSubfolderAndArticlesUseCase` and updates the UI state accordingly.  The `loadArticlesSuccess` and `loadArticlesError` functions manage successful and failed article loading scenarios, respectively.  Navigation-related events were also added to handle transitions to article details, folder details, external URLs and folder info.

Later modifications centered around the `_onFolderInfoClicked` function. Initially, it only emitted a loading state.  Subsequent updates integrated the `_getSolutionFolderInfoUseCase` to retrieve folder information and then transitioned the UI to either display the folder information in a bottom sheet using `FolderDetailNavigationState.openFolderInfoBottomSheet` or handle errors via `FolderDetailNavigationState.error`. The `FolderInfoUiModelMapper` was introduced to map the raw `FolderInfo` data to a UI-friendly `FolderInfoUiModel`. This mapper handles different visibility scenarios (all users, logged-in users, specific agents, departments, groups, or workspaces). This required adding parameters to the `FolderDetailEventFolderInfoClicked` event to pass necessary localization contexts and data for the mapper.  Finally,  the `_onLoadItems` function was updated to store the fetched `SolutionSubfoldersAndArticles` data in a private variable `_folderInfo` within the Bloc for later use in mapping folder info.  The  `_articlesCount` and `_subfoldersCount` variables were added to store article and subfolder counts from the response for use in the folder info mapping process.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/di/solution_ui_module.dart` file was also updated at 7:53:58 PM to register the `FolderDetailBloc` and its dependencies with a dependency injection framework (likely `fsDIComponent`). This ensured proper instantiation and dependency injection of the Bloc within the application.  The modification reflects a change in dependency injection from providing dependencies implicitly to explicitly passing dependencies to the constructor.
