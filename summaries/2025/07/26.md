# Activity Summary for 7/26/2025

## 2:12:23 AM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/user_lib` directory.  The updates center around data models and mappers related to a "BootstrapAccount."

The initial changes (around 9:55 PM and 9:57 PM) involve the creation and modification of data models (`workspace.dart`, `bootstrap_account_api_model_mapper.dart`).  `workspace.dart` defines a `WorkSpace` model with preferences, while `bootstrap_account_api_model_mapper.dart` introduces extensive extension methods for mapping between API models and data models for `BootstrapAccount`, `WorkSpace`, `WorkSpacePreferences`, and related entities. These mappers handle conversions between API responses and the application's internal data structures.

Subsequently (between 9:58 PM and 10:00 PM), several modifications were made to  `get_bootstrap_account_expected_result.dart`. This file appears to contain test data for a `GetBootstrapAccountUseCase`. The key changes here are additions and modifications to the `getWorkSpaceList()` function within the `GetBootstrapAccountExpectedIO` class.  This function populates a map of `WorkSpace` objects, with incremental changes seen between each commit: initially, only IDs were present in the keys, then names were added to the workspaces, and finally more workspace names like "IT2", "General", and "Finance" were introduced, suggesting a progressive refinement of test data to cover a wider range of workspace configurations.  The timestamps indicate these modifications happened within a short time span (around 2 minutes).  All other aspects of the `BootstrapAccount` (features, tempFeatures, etc) remain constant throughout these changes.


## 1:48:42 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, specifically within the `solution` module.  The main activity centers around  refining the `/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/solution/get_folder_info/success.json` file which contains mock JSON responses for a "Get Folder Info" API endpoint.

Initially, the `success.json` file contained two responses.  Response 1 represented a base case, while Response 2 demonstrated a change in the `visibility` field and group management (`group_ids` and `manage_by_group_ids`).  Subsequent updates added more responses, expanding the variety of mock data to include additional fields (e.g., `workspace_ids`, `department_ids`) and variations in their values.  The `updated_at` timestamps within the JSON responses reflect these changes over the time period of July 25th and 26th, 2025.  The most significant changes in the `success.json` file occurred between 1:08 PM and 1:09 PM on July 26th, 2025.

The majority of changes after 1:12 PM on July 26th, 2025, concern the generation of Dart code related to data layer using a prompt called `data_layer_codegen`. The promptâ€™s inputs were iteratively refined, primarily concerning the definition of the `visibility` enum in the response and specifying mandatory fields.  The output of this code generation are files related to data models (`folder_info_api_model.dart`, `folder_info_folder_api_model.dart`, etc.), data source (`solution_remote_data_source.dart`), repository (`solution_repository.dart`, `solution_repository_impl.dart`), mappers (`folder_info_api_model_mapper.dart`, etc.), and constants (`solution_remote_constants.dart`). The filepaths for these generated files are within the `features/solution/lib/src/data` directory.  There were numerous minor adjustments, primarily to ensure that the correct types are defined and null handling is implemented.  The final version of  `solution_remote_data_source.dart` includes multiple functions covering different solution-related API calls: `getSolutionCategories`, `getSolutionFolders`, `getSolutionSubfoldersAndArticles`, `searchSolutionArticles`, `getSolutionArticleDetail`, and `getFolderInfo`.  The `folder_info_folder_api_model.dart` file undergoes the most revisions, progressively simplifying the model by removing unnecessary fields and adjusting the types of fields like `manageByGroupIds`, `groupIds`, `workspaceIds`, and `departmentIds` to better reflect the needs of the application.  Between 1:29 PM and 1:34 PM on July 26th, 2025, the significant refactoring of the `folder_info_folder_api_model.dart` took place with the removal of redundant `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields and a clearer definition of data types for groups and departments.  The final changes consolidate related model definitions into a single file, improving the organization of the data layer code.


## 3:17:28 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/folder_info_api_model_mapper.dart` file between 1:48 PM and 2:08 PM on July 26, 2025.  These changes involved refining the mapping of API responses to data models for folder information.  The initial versions included multiple extension methods for different API model types.  Subsequent changes gradually simplified the code by consolidating the mappers and  handling null values more efficiently using the null-aware operator (`??`) and the `.nonNulls` extension.

A notable change around 1:58 PM involved switching the data source from using `id!` to `folder?.` to access nested properties within the API response model.  This points to a restructuring of the API response. The `_mapManageByGroups` function was significantly altered, changing its return type from a list of `FolderInfoManageByGroup` objects to a list of Strings. This suggests that the group IDs are now directly represented as strings in the API response, rather than requiring a separate mapper.  The final version uses only one `toDataModel` method to process the response.

Between 2:00 PM and 2:08 PM, the `_mapVisibility` function was modified to handle all cases, including a default "unknown" case, within the `_mapVisibility` function.  Also, the return types of the `_mapManageByGroups`, `FolderInfoDepartmentApiModelMapper`, and `FolderInfoManageByGroupApiModelMapper` were altered to be more consistent and efficient.

Finally, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/folder_info_api_model.dart` file was modified at 1:57 PM and 1:58 PM to remove the `id` field from the `FolderInfoFolderApiModel` class.

The changes in  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/usecase/get_folder_info_use_case.dart` between 2:11 PM and 2:13 PM show the evolution of a use case for retrieving folder information. Initially empty, it was then refined to become a `UseCase` that takes an integer (folder ID) as input and returns a `FolderInfo` object.  Further iterations improved the parameter handling and method naming (`call` changed to `protectedExecute`). The final version uses a custom parameter class `GetFolderInfoUseCaseParams` for improved clarity.

Lastly, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/di/solution_domain_module.dart` file shows the registration of the `GetFolderInfoUseCase` in the dependency injection module at 2:14 PM.  This is a standard dependency injection setup.  The `folder_info` data model was updated to use a freezed class to reflect the changes made to how data is retrieved from the API.
