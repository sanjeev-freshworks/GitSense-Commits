# Activity Summary for 7/26/2025

## 2:12:23 AM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/user_lib` directory.  The updates center around data models and mappers related to a "BootstrapAccount."

The initial changes (around 9:55 PM and 9:57 PM) involve the creation and modification of data models (`workspace.dart`, `bootstrap_account_api_model_mapper.dart`).  `workspace.dart` defines a `WorkSpace` model with preferences, while `bootstrap_account_api_model_mapper.dart` introduces extensive extension methods for mapping between API models and data models for `BootstrapAccount`, `WorkSpace`, `WorkSpacePreferences`, and related entities. These mappers handle conversions between API responses and the application's internal data structures.

Subsequently (between 9:58 PM and 10:00 PM), several modifications were made to  `get_bootstrap_account_expected_result.dart`. This file appears to contain test data for a `GetBootstrapAccountUseCase`. The key changes here are additions and modifications to the `getWorkSpaceList()` function within the `GetBootstrapAccountExpectedIO` class.  This function populates a map of `WorkSpace` objects, with incremental changes seen between each commit: initially, only IDs were present in the keys, then names were added to the workspaces, and finally more workspace names like "IT2", "General", and "Finance" were introduced, suggesting a progressive refinement of test data to cover a wider range of workspace configurations.  The timestamps indicate these modifications happened within a short time span (around 2 minutes).  All other aspects of the `BootstrapAccount` (features, tempFeatures, etc) remain constant throughout these changes.


## 1:48:42 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, specifically within the `solution` module.  The main activity centers around  refining the `/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/solution/get_folder_info/success.json` file which contains mock JSON responses for a "Get Folder Info" API endpoint.

Initially, the `success.json` file contained two responses.  Response 1 represented a base case, while Response 2 demonstrated a change in the `visibility` field and group management (`group_ids` and `manage_by_group_ids`).  Subsequent updates added more responses, expanding the variety of mock data to include additional fields (e.g., `workspace_ids`, `department_ids`) and variations in their values.  The `updated_at` timestamps within the JSON responses reflect these changes over the time period of July 25th and 26th, 2025.  The most significant changes in the `success.json` file occurred between 1:08 PM and 1:09 PM on July 26th, 2025.

The majority of changes after 1:12 PM on July 26th, 2025, concern the generation of Dart code related to data layer using a prompt called `data_layer_codegen`. The promptâ€™s inputs were iteratively refined, primarily concerning the definition of the `visibility` enum in the response and specifying mandatory fields.  The output of this code generation are files related to data models (`folder_info_api_model.dart`, `folder_info_folder_api_model.dart`, etc.), data source (`solution_remote_data_source.dart`), repository (`solution_repository.dart`, `solution_repository_impl.dart`), mappers (`folder_info_api_model_mapper.dart`, etc.), and constants (`solution_remote_constants.dart`). The filepaths for these generated files are within the `features/solution/lib/src/data` directory.  There were numerous minor adjustments, primarily to ensure that the correct types are defined and null handling is implemented.  The final version of  `solution_remote_data_source.dart` includes multiple functions covering different solution-related API calls: `getSolutionCategories`, `getSolutionFolders`, `getSolutionSubfoldersAndArticles`, `searchSolutionArticles`, `getSolutionArticleDetail`, and `getFolderInfo`.  The `folder_info_folder_api_model.dart` file undergoes the most revisions, progressively simplifying the model by removing unnecessary fields and adjusting the types of fields like `manageByGroupIds`, `groupIds`, `workspaceIds`, and `departmentIds` to better reflect the needs of the application.  Between 1:29 PM and 1:34 PM on July 26th, 2025, the significant refactoring of the `folder_info_folder_api_model.dart` took place with the removal of redundant `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields and a clearer definition of data types for groups and departments.  The final changes consolidate related model definitions into a single file, improving the organization of the data layer code.
