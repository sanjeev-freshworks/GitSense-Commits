# Activity Summary for 7/26/2025

## 2:12:23 AM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/user_lib` directory.  The updates center around data models and mappers related to a "BootstrapAccount."

The initial changes (around 9:55 PM and 9:57 PM) involve the creation and modification of data models (`workspace.dart`, `bootstrap_account_api_model_mapper.dart`).  `workspace.dart` defines a `WorkSpace` model with preferences, while `bootstrap_account_api_model_mapper.dart` introduces extensive extension methods for mapping between API models and data models for `BootstrapAccount`, `WorkSpace`, `WorkSpacePreferences`, and related entities. These mappers handle conversions between API responses and the application's internal data structures.

Subsequently (between 9:58 PM and 10:00 PM), several modifications were made to  `get_bootstrap_account_expected_result.dart`. This file appears to contain test data for a `GetBootstrapAccountUseCase`. The key changes here are additions and modifications to the `getWorkSpaceList()` function within the `GetBootstrapAccountExpectedIO` class.  This function populates a map of `WorkSpace` objects, with incremental changes seen between each commit: initially, only IDs were present in the keys, then names were added to the workspaces, and finally more workspace names like "IT2", "General", and "Finance" were introduced, suggesting a progressive refinement of test data to cover a wider range of workspace configurations.  The timestamps indicate these modifications happened within a short time span (around 2 minutes).  All other aspects of the `BootstrapAccount` (features, tempFeatures, etc) remain constant throughout these changes.
