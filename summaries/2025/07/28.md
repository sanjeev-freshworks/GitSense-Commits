# Activity Summary for 7/28/2025

## 2:26:15 AM
The log shows a series of code changes between 11:09 PM and 11:23 PM on July 27, 2025, primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory.  The most significant changes are in the `folder_detail_bloc_test.dart` file, which undergoes multiple revisions over a short period. These revisions appear to be iterative adjustments to unit tests for a `FolderDetailBloc`.  The tests cover various scenarios, including successful and erroneous loading of items, handling of navigation events (clearing navigation state after an action), and UI updates based on different events like clicking on articles, folders, or requesting folder information. The tests extensively use Mockito for mocking use cases and mappers.


The `folder_detail_bloc.dart` file also receives updates, mainly refining the Bloc's event handling and logging. A  `_tag` variable is added for improved logging within the `FolderDetailBloc` class, presumably for better debugging and tracking.


Changes in `folder_detail_screen.dart` are primarily related to UI improvements and handling user messages (showing SnackBars for errors) and improving logging. The `_tag` variable is also added for improved logging.


The `folder_info_widget.dart` file sees minor changes, mainly replacing some `SizedBox` initializations from `SizedBox(height: space20)` to `const SizedBox(height: space20)`, and similarly for other `SizedBox` instances.


Finally, `get_solution_folder_info_expected_io.dart` file undergoes minor changes, making the `UCResult` a `const` object in the `success()` function, and `bootstrap_account_fixture.dart`  shows several revisions focused on making many of its member functions and returned objects constants. This suggests an effort to improve code efficiency and maintainability, with the focus shifting toward immutability.


## 10:33:14 AM
The log shows a single code change on July 28, 2025, at 9:58:04 AM, affecting the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/folder_info_api_model.dart`.  This file defines several Dart classes using the `json_annotation` package for JSON serialization and deserialization.  The classes (`FolderInfoApiModel`, `FolderInfoFolderApiModel`, `FolderInfoDepartmentApiModel`, `FolderInfoGroupApiModel`, and `FolderInfoManageByGroupApiModel`) represent different aspects of folder information, including name, description, visibility, associated groups, departments, workspace IDs, and category information.  The code uses a common pattern of defining a class, its constructor, and `fromJson` and `toJson` factory constructors for JSON handling.  `FolderInfoManageByGroupApiModel` is the only class explicitly implementing `toJson`.


## 11:33:13 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/model/folder_detail_state.dart` file within a short time frame (between 11:31:08 AM and 11:32:07 AM on July 28, 2025).  The changes all center around the `FolderDetailState.content` constructor within a freezed sealed class.

The initial version included `FolderDetailNavigationState? navigationState` as a parameter.  Subsequent commits modified the `navigationState` parameter type from  `FolderDetailNavigationState?` to `bool FolderDetailNavigationState?` and then just `bool` before finally adding `isLoadingInfo` as a boolean parameter with a default value of `false` using the `@Default` annotation.  This suggests iterative development and refinement of the state management for the folder detail screen, likely related to loading indicators or UI state.  The core structure of the file (imports, freezed usage) remained consistent across all revisions.


## 12:33:17 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory, specifically within the `folder_detail` feature.  The changes span from 11:33 AM to 12:32 PM on July 28, 2025.

The most significant changes involved the `folder_detail_bloc.dart` file, undergoing multiple revisions between 11:33 AM and 11:35 AM. These revisions primarily focused on the `_onFolderInfoClicked` method within the `FolderDetailBloc` class.  The initial versions lacked a loading indicator and proper state management during the folder info retrieval process. Subsequent changes added an `isLoadingInfo` flag to the state, providing a loading indicator and improving error handling with `UserMessage.exception`.

Between 11:39 AM and 11:45 AM, the `folder_detail_content.dart` file was modified.  The initial version used a `RefreshIndicator` wrapped around a `PagedListView`.  A later revision changed the structure to a `Stack` containing the `RefreshIndicator` and a `Center` widget displaying a `FolderListLoader`, presumably to show a loading indicator during data fetching.  Finally, an `isLoadingInfo` boolean property was added to handle the loading state of folder information, impacting how the loading indicator is displayed. This file also handles the display of different item types (folders, articles, external articles) within the `PagedListView`.

Lastly, between 12:31 PM and 12:32 PM, the `article_detail_model.dart` file received major updates.  This file, initially empty or incomplete, was transformed to utilize the `freezed` package for efficient data class generation, creating a data model (`ArticleDetailModel`) to represent article details, derived from an API response model (`ArticleDetailResponseApiModel`).  The model includes fields like `id`, `title`, `description`, timestamps, folder name, user vote status, attachments, and cloud files.  The `fromApiModel` factory constructor facilitates conversion from the API model to the domain model.  The earlier attempts to define this model were incomplete or involved circular imports.


## 2:37:06 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/article_detail_model.dart` between 12:33 PM and 12:53 PM on July 28, 2025.  These changes primarily involve adding fields to the `ArticleDetailModel` class.  Initially, the model included basic article details like `id`, `title`, `description`, and timestamps.  Subsequent updates progressively added fields such as `modifiedBy`, `folderName`, `category`, `categoryName`, `language`, `author`, `workspaceId`, `views`, `thumbs` (later separated into `thumbsUp` and `thumbsDown`), `attachments`, and `cloudFiles` (later renamed `cloudAttachments`).  Import statements also changed to include `common_business` package.  The data types of some fields were also refined.

Around 12:40 PM, a new class, `ArticleLanguageModel`, was introduced and further refined, ultimately containing `id`, `name`, and `code` (of type `ArticleStatus`).  The `ArticleLanguageStatus` enum was created and then modified to include `value` and `getArticleLanguageStatus()` method. A similar `ArticleStatus` enum also underwent modification with `getArticleStatus()` method.  Finally,  `ArticleDetailModel` was updated to include a list of `ArticleLanguageModel` objects. All required fields in `ArticleDetailModel` were modified with `required` keyword at 12:43 PM.  The final version of `article_detail_model.dart` includes a comprehensive set of article details, including language information and status. The `part 'article_detail_model.freezed.dart'` line was added for Freezed package usage.  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/article_model.dart` shows a single update at 12:34 PM, adding a simpler article model with less detail than `ArticleDetailModel`.


## 4:57:10 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/article_detail_api_model.dart` between 4:29 PM and 4:41 PM on July 28, 2025.  These changes primarily involve altering the nullability of fields within the `ArticleDetailResponseApiModel` class. Initially, many fields were declared as `required`, then changed to `final`, and finally settled on using nullable types (`int?`, `String?`, `DateTime?`, etc.).  The `articleLanguages` field also underwent changes, evolving from  `List<ArticleLanguageModel>` to `List<Map<String, dynamic>>`.


Between 4:39 PM and 4:41 PM, an `AuthorApiModel` class was added, initially containing `name` and `email` fields, then simplified to only include the `name` field.  The `fromJson` method in this class also changed from a custom implementation to using `_$AuthorApiModelFromJson` generated by `freezed_annotation`.


The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/article_detail_response_api_model_mapper.dart` was modified between 4:50 PM and 4:56 PM on July 28, 2025.  The main change here was the creation of a mapper function `toDataModel` within the `ArticleDetailResponseApiModelMapper` extension. This function maps the `ArticleDetailResponseApiModel` to `ArticleDetailModel`.  It includes error handling for missing mandatory fields and utilizes helper functions (`_mapAttachments`, `_mapCloudAttachments`, `_mapArticleLanguages`) to map nested data structures.  The  `AuthorApiModelMapper` extension was also added during this period, mapping `AuthorApiModel` to a simple String.  The name of the mapper also changes from `toDomain` to `toDataModel` at this point.


Finally, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/presentation/bloc/article_detail_bloc.dart` shows minor changes between 4:42 PM and 4:42 PM on July 28, 2025. The most notable change is uncommenting the `on<ArticleDetailEventArticleInfoIconClicked>(_onArticleInfoIconClicked)` line within the `registerEvents()` function.  This suggests enabling handling of an article info icon click event.  The code within the `_onViewCreated` method remains largely unchanged, marked with TODO comments indicating future implementation of UI mapping and language assignment logic.


## 5:57:16 PM
The log shows a series of code modifications primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/article_detail_response_api_model_mapper.dart` file between 4:57 PM and 5:38 PM on July 28, 2025.  These changes center around the `_mapArticleLanguages` function within the `ArticleDetailResponseApiModelMapper` extension.  The initial versions of this function were commented out, suggesting an iterative development process to correctly map API responses to the `ArticleLanguageModel` data model.

The evolution of `_mapArticleLanguages` involved several stages:  Initially, it attempted to use `asMap()` and then `map()`, before finally settling on using `expand()` to iterate through the `translations` map.  The final version handles null checks for "id" and "name" within the mapped data and throws an exception if the article id is null.  The code also incorporates error handling using  `nonNulls` and a default empty list return to manage potential null values.

Between 5:01 PM and 5:04 PM,  the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/article_detail_model.dart` file was updated, changing the `ArticleLanguageModel` to use "language" instead of "name" for the language field.  This is likely due to a naming convention change reflecting data structure refactoring.


Subsequently, changes were made to the `SolutionRepository` and its implementation (`SolutionRepositoryImpl`) between 5:32 PM and 5:40 PM.  This involved refining the return type of the `getSolutionArticleDetail` method from `SolutionArticleDetail`, to `Article` and finally to `ArticleDetailModel`. This demonstrates a consistent effort to align the repository's interface and implementation with the `ArticleDetailModel` data structure.

Finally, between 5:52 PM and 5:56 PM, a new file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/presentation/mapper/article_detail_ui_model_mapper.dart`, was created and underwent several iterations. This file defines a mapper to translate between the data model (`ArticleDetailModel`) and the UI model (`ArticleDetailUiModel`).  The initial versions were incomplete ("TODO" comments were present). The final version includes a basic mapping function, `_mapFromDataModel`, that copies properties.


The overall pattern is one of incremental development and refinement, with a focus on robust handling of null values and consistent data modeling across different layers of the application (data, repository, and UI).


## 6:57:10 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to mapper classes within the `mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, specifically focusing on mapping data models to UI models for article details and related information.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/presentation/mapper/article_detail_ui_model_mapper.dart` file underwent initial changes between 5:57 PM and 5:58 PM on July 28, 2025.  The core change involved making the `_mapFromDataModel` function asynchronous using `Future.value` to return an `ArticleDetailUiModel` object.  This suggests a shift towards asynchronous data handling.

The `article_detail_state.dart` file was updated at 5:59 PM, defining a `sealed` class `ArticleDetailState` using the `freezed` annotation package to handle loading, error, and content states for article detail presentation. This indicates the use of a state management pattern.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/presentation/mapper/article_language_ui_model_mapper.dart` file shows a long series of revisions (from 6:05 PM to 6:18 PM).  The primary focus was refining the `ArticleLanguageUiModelMapperInput` class, initially having inconsistencies in the input type (`ArticleLanguageModel`, `ArticleDetailUiModel`, `ArticleDetailModel`). The final version of the mapper takes an `ArticleLanguageModel` and a `String` representing the current language as input and produces `ArticleLanguageUiModel`.   Crucially, the mapper now adds a `selected` boolean property and `isDraft` to indicate the selected language and draft status, improving UI presentation.  The numerous revisions suggest iterative debugging and refinement of the input parameters and output model.  The use of `ArticleLanguageStatus` enum is introduced for better type safety.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/presentation/mapper/article_info_ui_model_mapper.dart` file was modified between 6:19 PM and 6:23 PM.  Similar to the `article_language_ui_model_mapper`, this mapper was initially unstable in its input type and model output.  The final version maps `ArticleDetailModel` to `ArticleInfoUIModel`.  The key changes include adding fields like `createdOn` and `lastModifiedBy` to the UI model for richer display of article information.  There's some minor typos fixed in the variable names (`articleInfoModelj` to `articleInfoModel`).

In summary, the changes show a concerted effort to improve the data mapping process in the article detail section of the application, focusing on asynchronous operations, robust state management, and enriching the UI model with additional information for a more comprehensive user experience.  The multiple revisions in `article_language_ui_model_mapper.dart` highlight an iterative development process involving refinement of input types, adding new fields (`selected` and `isDraft`), and improving code clarity and consistency.
