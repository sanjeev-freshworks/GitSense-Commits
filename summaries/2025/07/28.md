# Activity Summary for 7/28/2025

## 2:26:15 AM
The log shows a series of code changes between 11:09 PM and 11:23 PM on July 27, 2025, primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory.  The most significant changes are in the `folder_detail_bloc_test.dart` file, which undergoes multiple revisions over a short period. These revisions appear to be iterative adjustments to unit tests for a `FolderDetailBloc`.  The tests cover various scenarios, including successful and erroneous loading of items, handling of navigation events (clearing navigation state after an action), and UI updates based on different events like clicking on articles, folders, or requesting folder information. The tests extensively use Mockito for mocking use cases and mappers.


The `folder_detail_bloc.dart` file also receives updates, mainly refining the Bloc's event handling and logging. A  `_tag` variable is added for improved logging within the `FolderDetailBloc` class, presumably for better debugging and tracking.


Changes in `folder_detail_screen.dart` are primarily related to UI improvements and handling user messages (showing SnackBars for errors) and improving logging. The `_tag` variable is also added for improved logging.


The `folder_info_widget.dart` file sees minor changes, mainly replacing some `SizedBox` initializations from `SizedBox(height: space20)` to `const SizedBox(height: space20)`, and similarly for other `SizedBox` instances.


Finally, `get_solution_folder_info_expected_io.dart` file undergoes minor changes, making the `UCResult` a `const` object in the `success()` function, and `bootstrap_account_fixture.dart`  shows several revisions focused on making many of its member functions and returned objects constants. This suggests an effort to improve code efficiency and maintainability, with the focus shifting toward immutability.


## 10:33:14 AM
The log shows a single code change on July 28, 2025, at 9:58:04 AM, affecting the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/folder_info_api_model.dart`.  This file defines several Dart classes using the `json_annotation` package for JSON serialization and deserialization.  The classes (`FolderInfoApiModel`, `FolderInfoFolderApiModel`, `FolderInfoDepartmentApiModel`, `FolderInfoGroupApiModel`, and `FolderInfoManageByGroupApiModel`) represent different aspects of folder information, including name, description, visibility, associated groups, departments, workspace IDs, and category information.  The code uses a common pattern of defining a class, its constructor, and `fromJson` and `toJson` factory constructors for JSON handling.  `FolderInfoManageByGroupApiModel` is the only class explicitly implementing `toJson`.


## 11:33:13 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/model/folder_detail_state.dart` file within a short time frame (between 11:31:08 AM and 11:32:07 AM on July 28, 2025).  The changes all center around the `FolderDetailState.content` constructor within a freezed sealed class.

The initial version included `FolderDetailNavigationState? navigationState` as a parameter.  Subsequent commits modified the `navigationState` parameter type from  `FolderDetailNavigationState?` to `bool FolderDetailNavigationState?` and then just `bool` before finally adding `isLoadingInfo` as a boolean parameter with a default value of `false` using the `@Default` annotation.  This suggests iterative development and refinement of the state management for the folder detail screen, likely related to loading indicators or UI state.  The core structure of the file (imports, freezed usage) remained consistent across all revisions.


## 12:33:17 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory, specifically within the `folder_detail` feature.  The changes span from 11:33 AM to 12:32 PM on July 28, 2025.

The most significant changes involved the `folder_detail_bloc.dart` file, undergoing multiple revisions between 11:33 AM and 11:35 AM. These revisions primarily focused on the `_onFolderInfoClicked` method within the `FolderDetailBloc` class.  The initial versions lacked a loading indicator and proper state management during the folder info retrieval process. Subsequent changes added an `isLoadingInfo` flag to the state, providing a loading indicator and improving error handling with `UserMessage.exception`.

Between 11:39 AM and 11:45 AM, the `folder_detail_content.dart` file was modified.  The initial version used a `RefreshIndicator` wrapped around a `PagedListView`.  A later revision changed the structure to a `Stack` containing the `RefreshIndicator` and a `Center` widget displaying a `FolderListLoader`, presumably to show a loading indicator during data fetching.  Finally, an `isLoadingInfo` boolean property was added to handle the loading state of folder information, impacting how the loading indicator is displayed. This file also handles the display of different item types (folders, articles, external articles) within the `PagedListView`.

Lastly, between 12:31 PM and 12:32 PM, the `article_detail_model.dart` file received major updates.  This file, initially empty or incomplete, was transformed to utilize the `freezed` package for efficient data class generation, creating a data model (`ArticleDetailModel`) to represent article details, derived from an API response model (`ArticleDetailResponseApiModel`).  The model includes fields like `id`, `title`, `description`, timestamps, folder name, user vote status, attachments, and cloud files.  The `fromApiModel` factory constructor facilitates conversion from the API model to the domain model.  The earlier attempts to define this model were incomplete or involved circular imports.


## 2:37:06 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/article_detail_model.dart` between 12:33 PM and 12:53 PM on July 28, 2025.  These changes primarily involve adding fields to the `ArticleDetailModel` class.  Initially, the model included basic article details like `id`, `title`, `description`, and timestamps.  Subsequent updates progressively added fields such as `modifiedBy`, `folderName`, `category`, `categoryName`, `language`, `author`, `workspaceId`, `views`, `thumbs` (later separated into `thumbsUp` and `thumbsDown`), `attachments`, and `cloudFiles` (later renamed `cloudAttachments`).  Import statements also changed to include `common_business` package.  The data types of some fields were also refined.

Around 12:40 PM, a new class, `ArticleLanguageModel`, was introduced and further refined, ultimately containing `id`, `name`, and `code` (of type `ArticleStatus`).  The `ArticleLanguageStatus` enum was created and then modified to include `value` and `getArticleLanguageStatus()` method. A similar `ArticleStatus` enum also underwent modification with `getArticleStatus()` method.  Finally,  `ArticleDetailModel` was updated to include a list of `ArticleLanguageModel` objects. All required fields in `ArticleDetailModel` were modified with `required` keyword at 12:43 PM.  The final version of `article_detail_model.dart` includes a comprehensive set of article details, including language information and status. The `part 'article_detail_model.freezed.dart'` line was added for Freezed package usage.  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/data/model/response/article_model.dart` shows a single update at 12:34 PM, adding a simpler article model with less detail than `ArticleDetailModel`.
