# Activity Summary for 7/28/2025

## 2:26:15 AM
The log shows a series of code changes between 11:09 PM and 11:23 PM on July 27, 2025, primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory.  The most significant changes are in the `folder_detail_bloc_test.dart` file, which undergoes multiple revisions over a short period. These revisions appear to be iterative adjustments to unit tests for a `FolderDetailBloc`.  The tests cover various scenarios, including successful and erroneous loading of items, handling of navigation events (clearing navigation state after an action), and UI updates based on different events like clicking on articles, folders, or requesting folder information. The tests extensively use Mockito for mocking use cases and mappers.


The `folder_detail_bloc.dart` file also receives updates, mainly refining the Bloc's event handling and logging. A  `_tag` variable is added for improved logging within the `FolderDetailBloc` class, presumably for better debugging and tracking.


Changes in `folder_detail_screen.dart` are primarily related to UI improvements and handling user messages (showing SnackBars for errors) and improving logging. The `_tag` variable is also added for improved logging.


The `folder_info_widget.dart` file sees minor changes, mainly replacing some `SizedBox` initializations from `SizedBox(height: space20)` to `const SizedBox(height: space20)`, and similarly for other `SizedBox` instances.


Finally, `get_solution_folder_info_expected_io.dart` file undergoes minor changes, making the `UCResult` a `const` object in the `success()` function, and `bootstrap_account_fixture.dart`  shows several revisions focused on making many of its member functions and returned objects constants. This suggests an effort to improve code efficiency and maintainability, with the focus shifting toward immutability.
