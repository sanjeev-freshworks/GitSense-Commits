# Activity Summary for 11/21/2025

## 2:07:35 AM
The provided log details several code changes across different parts of the Freshservice mobile Flutter project, occurring between November 12 and November 18, 2025.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM.
    *   This file provides extensive documentation for Asset APIs, covering both V1 and V2 endpoints. It details various operations such as getting and searching asset lists, associating/disassociating assets with tickets or changes, managing asset types, and retrieving vendor or product information. It also outlines requests (Method, Path, QueryParams, Payload) and expected JSON response bodies (e.g., `asset_list_success.json`, `main_form_fields/success.json`) for APIs like `Create Asset V2` and `Edit Asset V2`. The content remained identical across the two close timestamps, suggesting a save without functional change.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM.
    *   This BDD test step (`iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`) sets up a Flutter widget test environment. It configures the tester's view for an iPhone 11, pumps the `FSModuleAppWidget` with the `/support` initial route, and waits for the UI to settle for 10 seconds.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM and 8:07:09 PM.
    *   This BDD test step (`iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage`) verifies navigation to the support homepage by checking for the presence of specific UI elements, including notification and Freshservice logos, and various text strings (e.g., 'Hi, how can we help you?', 'Report issue', 'Request service', 'Browse help articles'). A quick correction was made between the two timestamps to fix a typo from "Complete your action a" to "Complete your action items".

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM and 7:06:48 PM.
    *   This Dart file defines a `sealed class SearchContentScreenEvent` and its subclasses, representing various events for a search content screen. The key change involved modifying the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor to explicitly require a `searchText` parameter. Other events include `SearchTextChanged`, `ResetPagingState`, `LoadSearchResults`, `ClickSearchItem`, and `NavigationHandled`.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**
    *   **Timestamp:** Multiple changes between 11/17/2025, 6:16:41 PM and 6:20:24 PM.
    *   This Android Manifest file specifies application permissions and configuration for the `fsmodule`. It consistently includes `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions. There were several rapid edits: an attempt to add detailed comments explaining speech-to-text permissions, a brief period where some permissions were accidentally duplicated, followed by a swift reversion that removed the extra comments and duplicated permissions. The `flutterEmbedding` version is set to `2`.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**
    *   **Timestamp:** Multiple changes between 11/17/2025, 7:21:56 PM and 7:26:12 PM.
    *   This Android Manifest file for `fs_ui_catalog_app` consistently requests `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions. It outlines standard Flutter activity settings and also uses Flutter embedding version `2`. No functional changes were observed across these timestamps, suggesting multiple saves of the same content.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/asset/requester_profile/view/components/requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/18/2025, 1:38:41 PM and 1:38:53 PM.
    *   This Dart file defines `RequesterAssetsListScreenRoot`, a StatefulWidget responsible for displaying a requester's asset list. The primary change was uncommenting a line within the `initState` method, which dispatches a `RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated` event. The widget handles different states (Loading, Content) to render appropriate UI components.

**Patterns and recurring elements:**

*   **Rapid Iteration:** Several files show multiple updates within a few minutes (e.g., `asset.md`, `i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`, `search_content_screen_event.dart`, and both `AndroidManifest.xml` files). This pattern suggests active development, debugging, or minor adjustments.
*   **Flutter Development Focus:** A significant portion of changes are related to Flutter: BDD test steps using `flutter_test`, Flutter UI widgets (`FSModuleAppWidget`, `RequesterAssetsListScreenRoot`), and Flutter-specific Android Manifest configurations (`flutterEmbedding`, activity settings).
*   **API Documentation:** Detailed API documentation (`asset.md`) is maintained, outlining methods, paths, parameters, and expected responses for asset management. This indicates a focus on clear API contracts.
*   **Android Permissions Management:** Both `AndroidManifest.xml` files show attention to necessary permissions like `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO`, with some transient changes related to detailed commenting and duplication, indicating careful management of app capabilities.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** The `SearchContentScreenEvent` sealed class points towards an event-driven or BLoC-like architecture for managing UI state and logic in the Flutter application.
*   **Freshservice Context:** All file paths and content relate to a "Freshservice" mobile application, suggesting these changes are part of ongoing development for Freshservice's mobile platform.
