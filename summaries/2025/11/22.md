# Activity Summary for 11/22/2025

## 2:07:35 AM
The provided log details code changes across various components of a Freshservice mobile Flutter application, encompassing API documentation, BDD test steps, event models, and Android manifest configurations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM
    *   This Markdown file serves as comprehensive documentation for Asset APIs, detailing both V1 and V2 endpoints. It lists numerous operations such as getting, searching, associating, attaching, detaching assets, retrieving asset types, main fields, CI type fields, vendor and product info, and creating/editing assets. Each API entry specifies the HTTP method (GET, PUT, POST), path, query parameters, and example JSON payloads/responses, linking to specific mock JSON files for success scenarios. The two timestamps show identical content, suggesting a re-save without functional changes.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM
    *   This file defines a BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) step `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`. It initializes the Flutter test environment, setting the tester's view to an iPhone 11 screen size and pumping the `FSModuleAppWidget` with `'/support'` as the initial route, then allowing a 10-second settlement for UI rendering.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM and 8:07:09 PM
    *   This BDD step `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage` asserts the visibility of specific UI elements to confirm successful navigation to the support homepage. The update at 8:07:09 PM involved a minor text correction, changing the expected text assertion from `'Complete your action a'` to `'Complete your action items'`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM and 7:06:48 PM
    *   This file defines `SearchContentScreenEvent`, a sealed class for events related to the search content screen. The key change at 7:06:48 PM updated the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor to explicitly require a `searchText` parameter, changing `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated()` to `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated({required this.searchText});`. Other events like `SearchContentScreenEventSearchTextChanged`, `SearchContentScreenEventResetPagingState`, `SearchContentScreenEventLoadSearchResults`, `SearchContentScreenEventClickSearchItem`, and `SearchContentScreenEventNavigationHandled` remained consistent.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 6:16:41 PM to 6:20:24 PM
    *   This Android Manifest file for the `fsmodule` application saw several rapid changes and reverts. It consistently declares `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions. Brief attempts were made to add comments explaining these permissions (particularly linking audio and Bluetooth permissions to a "speech-to-text" feature) and, in one instance, duplicate permission entries were temporarily introduced. All these additions (comments and duplicates) were subsequently reverted, indicating experimental changes or debugging. The `queries` block for `PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService` remained constant throughout.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 7:21:56 PM to 7:26:12 PM
    *   This Android Manifest file for the UI catalog app consistently includes `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions. Similar to the `fsmodule` manifest, it includes `queries` for `PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`. No functional changes were observed across the entries for this file; the content remained identical.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/asset/requester_profile/view/components/requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/18/2025, 1:38:41 PM and 1:38:53 PM
    *   This Flutter widget file `RequesterAssetsListScreenRoot` manages the display of requester assets. The notable change at 1:38:53 PM was uncommenting the line `widget.eventHandler(const RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated());` within the `initState` method. This change ensures that the `RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated` event is now dispatched upon the initialization of the widget's state, likely triggering initial data loading for the asset list.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **API Versioning:** The `asset.md` documentation clearly distinguishes between V1 and V2 APIs for asset management, indicating an ongoing migration or support for both versions.
*   **BDD Testing Practices:** The use of `bdd_widget_test` and specific `iSee...` and `iAmOn...` steps demonstrates a consistent approach to testing UI functionality and user flows in the Flutter application.
*   **Flutter Event-Driven Architecture:** The `SearchContentScreenEvent` sealed class and the dispatching of `RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated` from `initState` point to an event-driven or BLoC-like architecture for state management in Flutter.
*   **Android Permissions for Media/Speech:** Both `AndroidManifest.xml` files consistently request `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with queries for `android.speech.RecognitionService`. This strongly suggests the inclusion of speech-to-text functionality across the applications. The `fsmodule` app also requires `BLUETOOTH` related permissions.
*   **Development Activity:** Several files (`fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, `i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`, `search_content_screen_event.dart`, `requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart`) show quick, minor adjustments (text fixes, comment changes, adding/uncommenting single lines, constructor parameter changes) within short timeframes, which is typical of active development, debugging, and refinement cycles.

## 3:36:03 AM
The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` file, seen at timestamps 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 11/12/2025, 7:23:30 PM, is a comprehensive Markdown document outlining Freshservice's Asset API endpoints. It details numerous V2 APIs for managing assets, including associated assets for tickets and changes, asset types, searching, attaching/detaching assets, retrieving form fields, vendor details, product info, and creating/editing assets. It also lists several V1 APIs for asset types, listings, details, forms, creation, and updates. Each API entry specifies the HTTP method, path, query parameters, example payloads (for POST/PUT), and references to success JSON response bodies. The content appears identical across both timestamps, suggesting a re-save or log capture without functional changes in the documentation itself, and notably, the `Edit Asset V2` section is truncated in both instances.

In `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` (11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM), a Flutter BDD step `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage` is defined. This step sets up the test environment by adjusting the tester's view to simulate an iPhone 11 and then pumps the `FSModuleAppWidget` with the `"/support"` initial route, followed by a 10-second `pumpAndSettle` to ensure the UI is rendered.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` underwent a minor textual correction. At 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM, the test step checked for the text `'Complete your action a'`. By 11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM, this was updated to `'Complete your action items'`, correcting a grammatical error in the expected UI text. Other assertions in this step verify the presence of notification and FS logo images, and several key text labels on the support homepage.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart` file defines various events for a search content screen. A significant functional change occurred between 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM and 11/13/2025, 7:06:48 PM. The `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` class was modified to require a `searchText` parameter in its constructor, indicating that the view creation event now expects an initial search query. Other event classes like `SearchContentScreenEventSearchTextChanged`, `SearchContentScreenEventResetPagingState`, `SearchContentScreenEventLoadSearchResults`, `SearchContentScreenEventClickSearchItem`, and `SearchContentScreenEventNavigationHandled` remained consistent.

Android Manifest files show recurring patterns of minor updates and reverts related to permissions.
For `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, multiple changes occurred on 11/17/2025:
- **6:16:41 PM:** Initial state with `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions.
- **6:18:00 PM:** Added a detailed comment block explaining the purpose of these permissions, specifically for speech-to-text.
- **6:18:28 PM, 6:18:43 PM:** The detailed comment block was removed, reverting to the previous state of permissions with only the INTERNET comment.
- **6:20:09 PM:** Duplicate permission entries for `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` were added, along with new comments categorizing permissions for "Flutter development tools" and "speech-to-text feature".
- **6:20:24 PM:** The duplicate permission entries and the newly added comments were removed, effectively reverting the file to a clean state with single permission declarations and minimal comments.
This pattern suggests an iterative process of adding and refining comments and permissions, with temporary duplications and subsequent cleanups.

Similarly, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` appears at 11/17/2025, 7:21:56 PM, 7:25:54 PM, and 7:26:12 PM. Across these timestamps, the file consistently includes `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with standard Flutter activity configurations and queries for `PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`. All three entries are identical, indicating no functional changes and possibly just repeated logging of the same content.

Finally, in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/asset/requester_profile/view/components/requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart`, a functional change was made to the `RequesterAssetsListScreenRoot` StatefulWidget. At 11/18/2025, 1:38:41 PM, the `RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated` event trigger within the `initState` method was commented out. However, at 11/18/2025, 1:38:53 PM, this line was uncommented, reactivating the event to be fired upon the initialization of the widget's state, likely to trigger initial data fetching or UI setup for the asset list.
