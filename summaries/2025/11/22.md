# Activity Summary for 11/22/2025

## 2:07:35 AM
The provided log details code changes across various components of a Freshservice mobile Flutter application, encompassing API documentation, BDD test steps, event models, and Android manifest configurations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM
    *   This Markdown file serves as comprehensive documentation for Asset APIs, detailing both V1 and V2 endpoints. It lists numerous operations such as getting, searching, associating, attaching, detaching assets, retrieving asset types, main fields, CI type fields, vendor and product info, and creating/editing assets. Each API entry specifies the HTTP method (GET, PUT, POST), path, query parameters, and example JSON payloads/responses, linking to specific mock JSON files for success scenarios. The two timestamps show identical content, suggesting a re-save without functional changes.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM
    *   This file defines a BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) step `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`. It initializes the Flutter test environment, setting the tester's view to an iPhone 11 screen size and pumping the `FSModuleAppWidget` with `'/support'` as the initial route, then allowing a 10-second settlement for UI rendering.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM and 8:07:09 PM
    *   This BDD step `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage` asserts the visibility of specific UI elements to confirm successful navigation to the support homepage. The update at 8:07:09 PM involved a minor text correction, changing the expected text assertion from `'Complete your action a'` to `'Complete your action items'`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM and 7:06:48 PM
    *   This file defines `SearchContentScreenEvent`, a sealed class for events related to the search content screen. The key change at 7:06:48 PM updated the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor to explicitly require a `searchText` parameter, changing `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated()` to `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated({required this.searchText});`. Other events like `SearchContentScreenEventSearchTextChanged`, `SearchContentScreenEventResetPagingState`, `SearchContentScreenEventLoadSearchResults`, `SearchContentScreenEventClickSearchItem`, and `SearchContentScreenEventNavigationHandled` remained consistent.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 6:16:41 PM to 6:20:24 PM
    *   This Android Manifest file for the `fsmodule` application saw several rapid changes and reverts. It consistently declares `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions. Brief attempts were made to add comments explaining these permissions (particularly linking audio and Bluetooth permissions to a "speech-to-text" feature) and, in one instance, duplicate permission entries were temporarily introduced. All these additions (comments and duplicates) were subsequently reverted, indicating experimental changes or debugging. The `queries` block for `PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService` remained constant throughout.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 7:21:56 PM to 7:26:12 PM
    *   This Android Manifest file for the UI catalog app consistently includes `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions. Similar to the `fsmodule` manifest, it includes `queries` for `PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`. No functional changes were observed across the entries for this file; the content remained identical.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/asset/requester_profile/view/components/requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/18/2025, 1:38:41 PM and 1:38:53 PM
    *   This Flutter widget file `RequesterAssetsListScreenRoot` manages the display of requester assets. The notable change at 1:38:53 PM was uncommenting the line `widget.eventHandler(const RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated());` within the `initState` method. This change ensures that the `RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated` event is now dispatched upon the initialization of the widget's state, likely triggering initial data loading for the asset list.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **API Versioning:** The `asset.md` documentation clearly distinguishes between V1 and V2 APIs for asset management, indicating an ongoing migration or support for both versions.
*   **BDD Testing Practices:** The use of `bdd_widget_test` and specific `iSee...` and `iAmOn...` steps demonstrates a consistent approach to testing UI functionality and user flows in the Flutter application.
*   **Flutter Event-Driven Architecture:** The `SearchContentScreenEvent` sealed class and the dispatching of `RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated` from `initState` point to an event-driven or BLoC-like architecture for state management in Flutter.
*   **Android Permissions for Media/Speech:** Both `AndroidManifest.xml` files consistently request `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with queries for `android.speech.RecognitionService`. This strongly suggests the inclusion of speech-to-text functionality across the applications. The `fsmodule` app also requires `BLUETOOTH` related permissions.
*   **Development Activity:** Several files (`fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, `i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`, `search_content_screen_event.dart`, `requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart`) show quick, minor adjustments (text fixes, comment changes, adding/uncommenting single lines, constructor parameter changes) within short timeframes, which is typical of active development, debugging, and refinement cycles.
