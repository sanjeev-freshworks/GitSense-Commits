# Activity Summary for 11/22/2025

## 2:07:35 AM
The provided log details code changes across various components of a Freshservice mobile Flutter application, encompassing API documentation, BDD test steps, event models, and Android manifest configurations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM
    *   This Markdown file serves as comprehensive documentation for Asset APIs, detailing both V1 and V2 endpoints. It lists numerous operations such as getting, searching, associating, attaching, detaching assets, retrieving asset types, main fields, CI type fields, vendor and product info, and creating/editing assets. Each API entry specifies the HTTP method (GET, PUT, POST), path, query parameters, and example JSON payloads/responses, linking to specific mock JSON files for success scenarios. The two timestamps show identical content, suggesting a re-save without functional changes.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM
    *   This file defines a BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) step `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`. It initializes the Flutter test environment, setting the tester's view to an iPhone 11 screen size and pumping the `FSModuleAppWidget` with `'/support'` as the initial route, then allowing a 10-second settlement for UI rendering.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM and 8:07:09 PM
    *   This BDD step `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage` asserts the visibility of specific UI elements to confirm successful navigation to the support homepage. The update at 8:07:09 PM involved a minor text correction, changing the expected text assertion from `'Complete your action a'` to `'Complete your action items'`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM and 7:06:48 PM
    *   This file defines `SearchContentScreenEvent`, a sealed class for events related to the search content screen. The key change at 7:06:48 PM updated the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor to explicitly require a `searchText` parameter, changing `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated()` to `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated({required this.searchText});`. Other events like `SearchContentScreenEventSearchTextChanged`, `SearchContentScreenEventResetPagingState`, `SearchContentScreenEventLoadSearchResults`, `SearchContentScreenEventClickSearchItem`, and `SearchContentScreenEventNavigationHandled` remained consistent.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 6:16:41 PM to 6:20:24 PM
    *   This Android Manifest file for the `fsmodule` application saw several rapid changes and reverts. It consistently declares `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions. Brief attempts were made to add comments explaining these permissions (particularly linking audio and Bluetooth permissions to a "speech-to-text" feature) and, in one instance, duplicate permission entries were temporarily introduced. All these additions (comments and duplicates) were subsequently reverted, indicating experimental changes or debugging. The `queries` block for `PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService` remained constant throughout.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 7:21:56 PM to 7:26:12 PM
    *   This Android Manifest file for the UI catalog app consistently includes `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions. Similar to the `fsmodule` manifest, it includes `queries` for `PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`. No functional changes were observed across the entries for this file; the content remained identical.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/asset/requester_profile/view/components/requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/18/2025, 1:38:41 PM and 1:38:53 PM
    *   This Flutter widget file `RequesterAssetsListScreenRoot` manages the display of requester assets. The notable change at 1:38:53 PM was uncommenting the line `widget.eventHandler(const RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated());` within the `initState` method. This change ensures that the `RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated` event is now dispatched upon the initialization of the widget's state, likely triggering initial data loading for the asset list.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **API Versioning:** The `asset.md` documentation clearly distinguishes between V1 and V2 APIs for asset management, indicating an ongoing migration or support for both versions.
*   **BDD Testing Practices:** The use of `bdd_widget_test` and specific `iSee...` and `iAmOn...` steps demonstrates a consistent approach to testing UI functionality and user flows in the Flutter application.
*   **Flutter Event-Driven Architecture:** The `SearchContentScreenEvent` sealed class and the dispatching of `RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated` from `initState` point to an event-driven or BLoC-like architecture for state management in Flutter.
*   **Android Permissions for Media/Speech:** Both `AndroidManifest.xml` files consistently request `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with queries for `android.speech.RecognitionService`. This strongly suggests the inclusion of speech-to-text functionality across the applications. The `fsmodule` app also requires `BLUETOOTH` related permissions.
*   **Development Activity:** Several files (`fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, `i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`, `search_content_screen_event.dart`, `requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart`) show quick, minor adjustments (text fixes, comment changes, adding/uncommenting single lines, constructor parameter changes) within short timeframes, which is typical of active development, debugging, and refinement cycles.

## 3:36:03 AM
The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` file, seen at timestamps 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 11/12/2025, 7:23:30 PM, is a comprehensive Markdown document outlining Freshservice's Asset API endpoints. It details numerous V2 APIs for managing assets, including associated assets for tickets and changes, asset types, searching, attaching/detaching assets, retrieving form fields, vendor details, product info, and creating/editing assets. It also lists several V1 APIs for asset types, listings, details, forms, creation, and updates. Each API entry specifies the HTTP method, path, query parameters, example payloads (for POST/PUT), and references to success JSON response bodies. The content appears identical across both timestamps, suggesting a re-save or log capture without functional changes in the documentation itself, and notably, the `Edit Asset V2` section is truncated in both instances.

In `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` (11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM), a Flutter BDD step `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage` is defined. This step sets up the test environment by adjusting the tester's view to simulate an iPhone 11 and then pumps the `FSModuleAppWidget` with the `"/support"` initial route, followed by a 10-second `pumpAndSettle` to ensure the UI is rendered.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` underwent a minor textual correction. At 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM, the test step checked for the text `'Complete your action a'`. By 11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM, this was updated to `'Complete your action items'`, correcting a grammatical error in the expected UI text. Other assertions in this step verify the presence of notification and FS logo images, and several key text labels on the support homepage.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart` file defines various events for a search content screen. A significant functional change occurred between 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM and 11/13/2025, 7:06:48 PM. The `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` class was modified to require a `searchText` parameter in its constructor, indicating that the view creation event now expects an initial search query. Other event classes like `SearchContentScreenEventSearchTextChanged`, `SearchContentScreenEventResetPagingState`, `SearchContentScreenEventLoadSearchResults`, `SearchContentScreenEventClickSearchItem`, and `SearchContentScreenEventNavigationHandled` remained consistent.

Android Manifest files show recurring patterns of minor updates and reverts related to permissions.
For `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, multiple changes occurred on 11/17/2025:
- **6:16:41 PM:** Initial state with `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions.
- **6:18:00 PM:** Added a detailed comment block explaining the purpose of these permissions, specifically for speech-to-text.
- **6:18:28 PM, 6:18:43 PM:** The detailed comment block was removed, reverting to the previous state of permissions with only the INTERNET comment.
- **6:20:09 PM:** Duplicate permission entries for `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` were added, along with new comments categorizing permissions for "Flutter development tools" and "speech-to-text feature".
- **6:20:24 PM:** The duplicate permission entries and the newly added comments were removed, effectively reverting the file to a clean state with single permission declarations and minimal comments.
This pattern suggests an iterative process of adding and refining comments and permissions, with temporary duplications and subsequent cleanups.

Similarly, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` appears at 11/17/2025, 7:21:56 PM, 7:25:54 PM, and 7:26:12 PM. Across these timestamps, the file consistently includes `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with standard Flutter activity configurations and queries for `PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`. All three entries are identical, indicating no functional changes and possibly just repeated logging of the same content.

Finally, in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/asset/requester_profile/view/components/requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart`, a functional change was made to the `RequesterAssetsListScreenRoot` StatefulWidget. At 11/18/2025, 1:38:41 PM, the `RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated` event trigger within the `initState` method was commented out. However, at 11/18/2025, 1:38:53 PM, this line was uncommented, reactivating the event to be fired upon the initialization of the widget's state, likely to trigger initial data fetching or UI setup for the asset list.

## 5:04:49 AM
The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` file underwent two updates on **11/12/2025 at 7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM**. This Markdown file documents an extensive set of Asset APIs, categorized into V1 and V2, including operations like getting and searching asset lists, associating/detaching assets from tickets or changes, managing asset types, fetching vendor/product info, and full CRUD operations (Create, Edit) for assets. Each API entry details the HTTP method, path, query parameters, and example JSON payloads/responses. The V2 API documentation for `Create Asset V2` and `Edit Asset V2` provides a comprehensive example of an asset object, including various standard and type-specific fields like `compute_type`, `warranty`, `acquisition_date`, `serial_number`, and `cost`. Both timestamps reflect identical content, suggesting a re-save or minor, non-substantive change not visible in the provided diff.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` was updated on **11/12/2025 at 7:59:04 PM**. This change introduced a Flutter BDD step function named `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`. This function is designed to set up the test environment by configuring the tester's view to an iPhone 11 size, pumping the main `FSModuleAppWidget` with the `/support` initial route, and waiting for the UI to settle, indicating the user is on the support home page.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` saw two updates. The initial change on **11/12/2025 at 8:07:02 PM** added a BDD step function `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage`. This function asserts the presence of specific UI elements (icons and text messages) that confirm successful navigation to the support homepage. A subsequent minor update on **11/12/2025 at 8:07:09 PM** corrected a typo in a text assertion from 'Complete your action a' to 'Complete your action items'.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart` was modified twice. On **11/13/2025 at 7:06:42 PM**, a sealed class `SearchContentScreenEvent` was defined along with several subclasses representing different events for a search content screen, such as `ViewCreated`, `SearchTextChanged`, `ResetPagingState`, `LoadSearchResults`, `ClickSearchItem`, and `NavigationHandled`. A notable change occurred on **11/13/2025 at 7:06:48 PM**, where the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor was updated to explicitly require a `searchText` parameter, changing its signature from `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated();` to `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated({required this.searchText});`.

The Android Manifest file for the `fsmodule` app, located at `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, was frequently updated on **11/17/2025**.
*   At **6:16:41 PM**, it contained standard permissions (`INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`) and declarations for the main activity and Flutter embedding.
*   At **6:18:00 PM**, comments were added to explain the permissions related to a "speech-to-text" feature.
*   At **6:18:28 PM** and **6:18:43 PM**, these comments were removed, reverting the file to a state similar to the first entry.
*   At **6:20:09 PM**, more detailed comments for permissions were re-added, distinguishing between Flutter development tools and speech-to-text requirements. Crucially, the `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions were duplicated in this version.
*   Finally, at **6:20:24 PM**, the duplicated permissions and the extensive comments were removed, returning the manifest to its concise state with only the core permissions and minimal comments, similar to the initial `6:16:41 PM` version. This series of changes indicates an experimental phase around adding and documenting permissions, particularly for speech-to-text, followed by a revert.

The Android Manifest file for the `fs_ui_catalog_app` at `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` was also updated on **11/17/2025** at **7:21:56 PM, 7:25:54 PM, and 7:26:12 PM**. This manifest includes `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with standard Flutter activity and embedding configurations. Unlike the `fsmodule` manifest, it did not include Bluetooth permissions in the log entries. All three timestamps for this file show identical content, suggesting multiple saves without functional changes.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/asset/requester_profile/view/components/requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart` was updated twice on **11/18/2025**.
*   At **1:38:41 PM**, it defined `RequesterAssetsListScreenRoot`, a Flutter StatefulWidget for displaying requester assets. The `initState` method contained a commented-out line: `// widget.eventHandler(const RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated());`.
*   At **1:38:53 PM**, this previously commented-out line was uncommented, activating the dispatch of the `RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated` event upon the widget's initialization. This marks a functional change in how the asset list screen initializes its data or state.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Flutter UI Development:** A significant portion of the changes are related to Flutter UI components and testing, including BDD steps for navigating and asserting UI states.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** The updates to `SearchContentScreenEvent` and `RequesterAssetsListScreenRoot` indicate a consistent use of event-driven patterns for state management and interaction in the UI.
*   **Android Permissions Management:** There's a recurring pattern of modifying `AndroidManifest.xml` files, specifically for `RECORD_AUDIO` and `BLUETOOTH` permissions, often accompanied by comments related to speech-to-text features, suggesting ongoing integration or experimentation with voice capabilities.
*   **API Documentation:** The detailed `asset.md` file highlights the comprehensive documentation practices for both V1 and V2 APIs, indicating a structured approach to API development and evolution.
*   **Minor Iterative Changes:** Many individual log entries show very small, focused changes (e.g., fixing a typo in a test, uncommenting a line, adding a `required` keyword) demonstrating continuous refinement and development.

## 7:04:11 AM
The code changes primarily involve documentation for Asset APIs, updates to Android manifest files for new permissions, and refinements to Flutter UI event handling and BDD test steps.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM**
        A comprehensive markdown document detailing Asset APIs was added. This document outlines various V1 and V2 APIs, including operations for associated assets, searching assets, managing asset types, attaching/detaching assets to tickets/changes, retrieving main and CI type fields, getting vendor/product information, listing assets, and creating/editing assets (V2). Each API is described with its HTTP method, path, query parameters, payload examples, and links to mock response JSON files.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 7:23:30 PM**
        No functional changes were observed; the content remained identical to the previous entry, suggesting a re-save or minor, unlogged modification.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM**
        A new BDD step definition file was created. This file defines the `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage` function, which initializes the Flutter `WidgetTester` for an iPhone 11 device, navigates to the "/support" route of the `FSModuleAppWidget`, and allows time for the UI to settle. This indicates the addition of a new automated test helper.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM**
        An initial BDD step definition `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage` was added. This step asserts the presence of specific UI images (`icNotifications`, `icFSLogo`) and various text elements ('Hi, how can we help you?', 'Report issue', 'Request service', 'Complete your action a', 'Browse help articles') on the support homepage to verify successful navigation.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM**
        A minor correction was made to a UI text assertion within the `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage` function, changing the expected text from 'Complete your action a' to 'Complete your action items'.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/13/2025, 7:06:48 PM**
        The `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` class's constructor was updated. It now requires a `searchText` parameter, changing `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated()` to `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated({required this.searchText});`. This ensures that the search text is explicitly passed when the search content screen view is created.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/17/2025, 6:18:00 PM**
        Comments were added to several `uses-permission` tags (`INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH` related) to clarify their purpose, specifically mentioning their role in Flutter development tools (hot reload, debugging) and speech-to-text functionality.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/17/2025, 6:20:09 PM**
        Some permissions (`RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`) were accidentally duplicated within the manifest.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/17/2025, 6:20:24 PM**
        The duplicated permissions from the previous change were removed, reverting the permission list to a non-redundant state, while retaining the updated comments.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/17/2025, 7:21:56 PM**
        The manifest includes `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with `queries` for `android.intent.action.PROCESS_TEXT` and `android.speech.RecognitionService`. Subsequent entries (7:25:54 PM and 7:26:12 PM) show identical content, indicating no functional changes across these timestamps.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/asset/requester_profile/view/components/requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/18/2025, 1:38:53 PM**
        A line previously commented out in the `initState` method, `widget.eventHandler(const RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated());`, was uncommented. This means the `RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated` event is now consistently dispatched when the `RequesterAssetsListScreenRoot` widget initializes its state.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Android Manifest Adjustments:** There's a recurring theme of managing Android permissions, particularly `RECORD_AUDIO` and `BLUETOOTH` related permissions, and `queries` for speech recognition services (`android.speech.RecognitionService`) across different Flutter applications (`fsmodule` and `fs_ui_catalog_app`). This suggests ongoing development or refinement of features involving voice input or audio interactions.
*   **BDD Test Development:** Consistent creation and slight modifications of BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) test step definitions (`i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`, `i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`) indicate an active focus on automated UI testing for the `support_portal` feature.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture Refinement:** Changes in event models (`SearchContentScreenEvent`) and widget initialization logic (`RequesterAssetsListScreenRoot`) highlight a continuous effort to refine the event-driven architecture within the Flutter application's UI components, ensuring proper state management and data flow.
*   **Documentation Focus:** The extensive update to `asset.md` signals a significant effort in documenting the API landscape for assets, providing clear specifications for both V1 and V2 endpoints, which is crucial for development and maintenance.
*   **Minor Fixes/Cleanups:** Several entries show very minor changes (like text correction in a test) or reversions of accidental edits (like duplicated permissions), pointing to typical iterative development and code hygiene practices.
