# Activity Summary for 11/14/2025

## 1:48:44 AM
The `documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` file, updated at **11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM** and again identically at **7:23:30 PM**, provides comprehensive Markdown documentation for Freshservice Asset APIs. This document details both V1 and V2 API endpoints for asset management, covering operations like getting and searching assets, managing associated assets for tickets and changes, retrieving asset types and fields, vendor and product information, and creating/editing assets. It specifies HTTP methods, paths, query parameters, and example JSON payloads/responses for each endpoint.

In the Flutter application's test suite, the file `/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` was added at **11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM**. This new BDD step defines how to set up the test environment to simulate being on the support home page, including setting device size for testing and navigating to the `/support` route within the `FSModuleAppWidget`.

The file `/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` underwent two rapid updates. At **11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM**, a BDD step was introduced to verify successful navigation to the support homepage by asserting the presence of specific UI images (notifications, FS logo) and text elements (e.g., "Hi, how can we help you?", "Report issue", "Request service", "Complete your action a", "Browse help articles"). Seven seconds later, at **11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM**, this file was immediately updated to correct a typo in one of the text assertions, changing "Complete your action a" to "Complete your action items".

Within the common UI library, the file `/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart` saw two updates within seconds. Initially, at **11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM**, a sealed class `SearchContentScreenEvent` and its various subclasses (e.g., `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated`, `SearchContentScreenEventSearchTextChanged`, `SearchContentScreenEventLoadSearchResults`) were defined to represent different events in a search content screen. Six seconds later, at **11/13/2025, 7:06:48 PM**, the constructor for `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` was modified to make the `searchText` parameter explicitly `required`.

A recurring pattern in these changes is the rapid iteration and correction of code, particularly evident in the BDD test steps and the search event definitions, where subsequent commits followed almost immediately to fix typos or refine parameter requirements. The updates also highlight active development in both API documentation and Flutter BDD testing for a Freshservice mobile application, alongside structural refinements in its common UI library's event handling.
