# Activity Summary for 11/20/2025

## 12:21:16 AM
The log details recent changes across documentation, BDD test steps, Flutter event models, Android manifest configurations, and Flutter UI components.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md**
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 11/12/2025, 7:23:30 PM.
    *   **Changes:** No discernible content changes were found between the two entries. Both entries present a comprehensive list of Asset API endpoints (V1 and V2), including details for `GET`, `PUT`, `POST` methods, query parameters, payloads, and response bodies, specifically for managing assets, associated assets, asset types, vendors, and products. The content appears to be a documentation snapshot.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM.
    *   **Changes:** A new BDD step `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage` was defined. This step configures the tester's view for an iPhone 11, then pumps the `FSModuleAppWidget` routing to `/support` and settles for 10 seconds, likely simulating the initial navigation to the support homepage in a test environment.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM.
    *   **Changes:** Initially, the BDD step `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage` included a verification for the text 'Complete your action a'.
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM.
    *   **Changes:** This verification text was corrected from 'Complete your action a' to 'Complete your action items', implying a refinement in the expected UI text for the support homepage. Other verifications for images (notifications, FS logo) and texts (e.g., 'Hi, how can we help you?', 'Report issue', 'Request service', 'Browse help articles') remained consistent.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM.
    *   **Changes:** The `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor was initially defined without requiring a `searchText` parameter.
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/13/2025, 7:06:48 PM.
    *   **Changes:** The `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor was modified to explicitly require a `searchText` parameter, indicating that the initial view creation event for the search content screen will now always carry the current search text. Other search-related events like `SearchTextChanged`, `ResetPagingState`, `LoadSearchResults`, `ClickSearchItem`, and `NavigationHandled` remained unchanged.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 6:16:41 PM.
    *   **Changes:** Permissions for `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` were added to the Android manifest. `RECORD_AUDIO` and `INTERNET` permissions were already present.
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 6:18:00 PM.
    *   **Changes:** A detailed comment was added describing the purpose of microphone, internet, audio recording, and network state permissions for the speech-to-text feature. The permission list itself was functionally the same as the prior version.
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/17/2025, 6:18:28 PM and 11/17/2025, 6:18:43 PM.
    *   **Changes:** No discernible changes from the 6:18:00 PM version.
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 6:20:09 PM.
    *   **Changes:** The `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions were duplicated in the manifest. A general comment about Flutter development tools was also added.
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 6:20:24 PM.
    *   **Changes:** The duplicated permission entries were removed, and the general comment for Flutter development tools was also removed, essentially reverting the changes made at 6:20:09 PM.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 7:21:56 PM.
    *   **Changes:** The initial state of this Android Manifest includes `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with `queries` for `PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`.
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/17/2025, 7:25:54 PM and 11/17/2025, 7:26:12 PM.
    *   **Changes:** No discernible changes were made to this file across these timestamps.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/asset/requester_profile/view/components/requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/18/2025, 1:38:41 PM.
    *   **Changes:** The `RequesterAssetsListScreenRoot` widget's `initState` method had the event handler call `widget.eventHandler(const RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated());` commented out.
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/18/2025, 1:38:53 PM.
    *   **Changes:** The previously commented-out line `widget.eventHandler(const RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated());` was uncommented, activating the dispatch of the `ViewCreated` event upon initialization of the asset list screen.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Android Permissions and Speech-to-Text:** A significant pattern is the repeated modification of `AndroidManifest.xml` files in both `fsmodule` and `fs_ui_catalog_app`. These changes consistently involve permissions related to audio recording (`RECORD_AUDIO`) and Bluetooth connectivity (`BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`), often alongside `android.speech.RecognitionService` queries. This strongly suggests ongoing development or refinement of a speech-to-text or voice input feature within the Freshservice mobile application, including some temporary permission duplication and subsequent cleanup in the `fsmodule` app.
*   **BDD Test Refinements:** Updates to BDD step definitions, particularly in `i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`, indicate continuous improvement and accuracy checks in the automated testing suite for UI interactions and displayed text.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture Adjustments:** Changes in `search_content_screen_event.dart` and `requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart` highlight a focus on refining event handling within the Flutter application. Specifically, ensuring that `ViewCreated` events carry necessary data (like `searchText`) and that these events are correctly dispatched upon component initialization.
