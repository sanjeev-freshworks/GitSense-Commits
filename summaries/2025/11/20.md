# Activity Summary for 11/20/2025

## 12:21:16 AM
The log details recent changes across documentation, BDD test steps, Flutter event models, Android manifest configurations, and Flutter UI components.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md**
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 11/12/2025, 7:23:30 PM.
    *   **Changes:** No discernible content changes were found between the two entries. Both entries present a comprehensive list of Asset API endpoints (V1 and V2), including details for `GET`, `PUT`, `POST` methods, query parameters, payloads, and response bodies, specifically for managing assets, associated assets, asset types, vendors, and products. The content appears to be a documentation snapshot.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM.
    *   **Changes:** A new BDD step `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage` was defined. This step configures the tester's view for an iPhone 11, then pumps the `FSModuleAppWidget` routing to `/support` and settles for 10 seconds, likely simulating the initial navigation to the support homepage in a test environment.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM.
    *   **Changes:** Initially, the BDD step `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage` included a verification for the text 'Complete your action a'.
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM.
    *   **Changes:** This verification text was corrected from 'Complete your action a' to 'Complete your action items', implying a refinement in the expected UI text for the support homepage. Other verifications for images (notifications, FS logo) and texts (e.g., 'Hi, how can we help you?', 'Report issue', 'Request service', 'Browse help articles') remained consistent.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM.
    *   **Changes:** The `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor was initially defined without requiring a `searchText` parameter.
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/13/2025, 7:06:48 PM.
    *   **Changes:** The `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor was modified to explicitly require a `searchText` parameter, indicating that the initial view creation event for the search content screen will now always carry the current search text. Other search-related events like `SearchTextChanged`, `ResetPagingState`, `LoadSearchResults`, `ClickSearchItem`, and `NavigationHandled` remained unchanged.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 6:16:41 PM.
    *   **Changes:** Permissions for `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` were added to the Android manifest. `RECORD_AUDIO` and `INTERNET` permissions were already present.
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 6:18:00 PM.
    *   **Changes:** A detailed comment was added describing the purpose of microphone, internet, audio recording, and network state permissions for the speech-to-text feature. The permission list itself was functionally the same as the prior version.
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/17/2025, 6:18:28 PM and 11/17/2025, 6:18:43 PM.
    *   **Changes:** No discernible changes from the 6:18:00 PM version.
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 6:20:09 PM.
    *   **Changes:** The `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions were duplicated in the manifest. A general comment about Flutter development tools was also added.
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 6:20:24 PM.
    *   **Changes:** The duplicated permission entries were removed, and the general comment for Flutter development tools was also removed, essentially reverting the changes made at 6:20:09 PM.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 7:21:56 PM.
    *   **Changes:** The initial state of this Android Manifest includes `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with `queries` for `PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`.
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/17/2025, 7:25:54 PM and 11/17/2025, 7:26:12 PM.
    *   **Changes:** No discernible changes were made to this file across these timestamps.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/asset/requester_profile/view/components/requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/18/2025, 1:38:41 PM.
    *   **Changes:** The `RequesterAssetsListScreenRoot` widget's `initState` method had the event handler call `widget.eventHandler(const RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated());` commented out.
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/18/2025, 1:38:53 PM.
    *   **Changes:** The previously commented-out line `widget.eventHandler(const RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated());` was uncommented, activating the dispatch of the `ViewCreated` event upon initialization of the asset list screen.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Android Permissions and Speech-to-Text:** A significant pattern is the repeated modification of `AndroidManifest.xml` files in both `fsmodule` and `fs_ui_catalog_app`. These changes consistently involve permissions related to audio recording (`RECORD_AUDIO`) and Bluetooth connectivity (`BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`), often alongside `android.speech.RecognitionService` queries. This strongly suggests ongoing development or refinement of a speech-to-text or voice input feature within the Freshservice mobile application, including some temporary permission duplication and subsequent cleanup in the `fsmodule` app.
*   **BDD Test Refinements:** Updates to BDD step definitions, particularly in `i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`, indicate continuous improvement and accuracy checks in the automated testing suite for UI interactions and displayed text.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture Adjustments:** Changes in `search_content_screen_event.dart` and `requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart` highlight a focus on refining event handling within the Flutter application. Specifically, ensuring that `ViewCreated` events carry necessary data (like `searchText`) and that these events are correctly dispatched upon component initialization.

## 1:21:10 AM
The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` file underwent two log entries on 11/12/2025, at 7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM, but the content remained identical across both timestamps. This file serves as a comprehensive documentation for Asset APIs, categorizing them into V2 and V1. It outlines various endpoints including associated assets (for tickets and changes), searching and retrieving asset lists, managing asset types, attaching and detaching assets, fetching main and CI type fields, retrieving vendor and product information, and creating/editing assets. Each API entry details the method, path, query parameters, payload structure, and references to mock JSON responses, illustrating a full range of asset management functionalities.

In the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` file, an update at 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM defined a BDD step. This step configures the Flutter `WidgetTester` for an iPhone 11 device size and ratio, then pumps the `FSModuleAppWidget` with an initial route of "/support" to simulate navigating to the support home page for testing purposes.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` saw a minor text correction between 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM and 11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM. The text assertion `iSeeText(tester, 'Complete your action a')` was updated to `iSeeText(tester, 'Complete your action items')`. This BDD step verifies successful navigation to the support homepage by checking for the presence of specific UI images (notifications, FS Logo) and text elements (e.g., "Hi, how can we help you?", "Report issue", "Request service", "Browse help articles").

For `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart`, a change occurred between 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM and 7:06:48 PM. The `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor was modified from a parameter-less constructor to one requiring a `searchText` parameter: `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated({required this.searchText});`. This file defines a sealed class `SearchContentScreenEvent` and its subclasses, representing various events within a search content screen, such as view creation, search text changes, paging resets, search result loading, and item clicks, indicating an event-driven architecture for search functionality.

The `AndroidManifest.xml` file for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/` shows several iterative changes on 11/17/2025. Between 6:16:41 PM and 6:18:00 PM, comments were added to explain the necessity of `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions for speech-to-text features. These comments were then reverted at 6:18:28 PM, and later at 6:20:09 PM, comments were re-introduced alongside a temporary duplication of the speech-to-text related permissions. Finally, at 6:20:24 PM, both the duplicate permissions and the new comments were removed, returning the file to a state similar to its initial configuration with `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, and Bluetooth permissions, along with `<queries>` for `PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`.

The `AndroidManifest.xml` file for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/` shows three log entries on 11/17/2025, between 7:21:56 PM and 7:26:12 PM. All these entries depict identical content. The manifest declares `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions and includes `<queries>` for text processing and speech recognition services, similar to the `fsmodule` manifest, but without the additional Bluetooth permissions or iterative changes observed in the `fsmodule` manifest.

Lastly, the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/asset/requester_profile/view/components/requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart` was updated between 11/18/2025, 1:38:41 PM and 1:38:53 PM. The `initState()` method was modified to uncomment `widget.eventHandler(const RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated());`, activating the dispatch of a `RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated` event upon the widget's initialization. This component is responsible for displaying the requester's asset list, handling loading states, and displaying content.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Saves/Minor Edits:** Many files show multiple log entries within seconds or minutes, often reflecting minor changes like text corrections, uncommenting code, or adding/removing comments in Android Manifests. This suggests an active development and refinement process.
*   **Flutter Development Focus:** The codebase is clearly within a Flutter environment, utilizing `flutter_test`, `WidgetTester`, and Flutter widget structures (`StatefulWidget`).
*   **BDD Testing Practices:** The inclusion of "bdd_steps" directories and associated `.dart` files indicates the adoption of Behavior-Driven Development for testing UI interactions and navigation.
*   **API Documentation:** A dedicated markdown file provides detailed API mock specifications, highlighting a structured approach to API design and documentation, distinguishing between V1 and V2 endpoints.
*   **Event-Driven UI Architecture:** The changes in `search_content_screen_event.dart` and `requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart` underscore an event-driven pattern in the UI, where actions and state changes are managed through distinct event objects and handlers.
*   **Android Permissions Management:** `AndroidManifest.xml` files across different applications consistently address necessary Android permissions, particularly `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, and Bluetooth-related permissions, along with intent queries for speech recognition, indicating a focus on features requiring these system capabilities.
