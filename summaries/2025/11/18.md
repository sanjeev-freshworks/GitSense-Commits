# Activity Summary for 11/18/2025

## 12:26:33 AM
The `freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` file received significant updates around **November 12, 2025, 7:23 PM**. This file provides comprehensive documentation for Asset APIs, detailing both V2 and V1 endpoints. It covers a wide range of functionalities including getting and searching assets, managing associated assets for tickets and changes, handling asset types, attaching/detaching assets, retrieving main and CI type fields, vendor and product information, and creating/editing assets. The documentation specifies API methods (GET, PUT, POST), paths, query parameters, payload examples, and references to JSON response bodies, indicating a robust effort to document API interactions.

BDD test steps for the support module were introduced and refined on **November 12, 2025**.
*   The file `apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` (timestamp: **7:59:04 PM**) adds a test step to set up the environment for the support home page, including setting device dimensions (iPhone 11) and pumping the `FSModuleAppWidget`.
*   The file `apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` saw two updates (timestamps: **8:07:02 PM** and **8:07:09 PM**). The latter corrected a typo in a text assertion from "Complete your action a" to "Complete your action items", indicating a refinement in test case accuracy.

The `libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart` file, defining event classes for a search content screen, was updated on **November 13, 2025**.
*   Initially (timestamp: **7:06:42 PM**), the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` event class was defined without requiring a `searchText` parameter in its constructor.
*   A subsequent update (timestamp: **7:06:48 PM**) modified `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` to explicitly require `searchText` in its constructor, suggesting a change in how the initial view creation event is handled, now always expecting a search query.

Several `AndroidManifest.xml` files across different applications were modified on **November 17, 2025**, primarily related to Android permissions.
*   For `apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, multiple changes occurred between **6:16 PM and 6:20 PM**. Initial permissions included `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, and various `BLUETOOTH` permissions. A key update at **6:18:00 PM** added comments clarifying that `RECORD_AUDIO` and related Bluetooth permissions are specifically for a "speech-to-text" feature. There were also transient changes involving duplicate permission declarations that were subsequently removed by **6:20:24 PM**, leaving the permissions correctly declared with explanatory comments.
*   For `apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, the file consistently included `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with queries for `android.content.Intent.ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT` and `android.speech.RecognitionService` across multiple timestamps between **7:21 PM and 7:26 PM**. No functional changes were observed in this file during these updates, suggesting minor saves or checks.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **API Documentation Focus**: A significant effort was made to document Asset APIs, highlighting development or formalization of backend interactions.
*   **BDD Testing Adoption**: The introduction and refinement of BDD test steps indicate a commitment to behavior-driven development and robust testing practices for the mobile application's UI.
*   **Speech-to-Text Integration**: Consistent presence and explicit comments regarding `RECORD_AUDIO` and speech recognition services in `AndroidManifest.xml` files across different apps suggest ongoing integration or enhancement of speech-to-text capabilities within Freshservice mobile applications.
*   **Event-Driven UI Architecture**: The updates to `SearchContentScreenEvent` demonstrate a structured approach to managing UI events, with careful consideration for required data during event emission.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: Several files show very close timestamps for multiple changes, indicating quick iterative updates, typo fixes, or minor structural adjustments within a short development window.
