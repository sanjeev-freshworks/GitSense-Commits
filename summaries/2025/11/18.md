# Activity Summary for 11/18/2025

## 12:26:33 AM
The `freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` file received significant updates around **November 12, 2025, 7:23 PM**. This file provides comprehensive documentation for Asset APIs, detailing both V2 and V1 endpoints. It covers a wide range of functionalities including getting and searching assets, managing associated assets for tickets and changes, handling asset types, attaching/detaching assets, retrieving main and CI type fields, vendor and product information, and creating/editing assets. The documentation specifies API methods (GET, PUT, POST), paths, query parameters, payload examples, and references to JSON response bodies, indicating a robust effort to document API interactions.

BDD test steps for the support module were introduced and refined on **November 12, 2025**.
*   The file `apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` (timestamp: **7:59:04 PM**) adds a test step to set up the environment for the support home page, including setting device dimensions (iPhone 11) and pumping the `FSModuleAppWidget`.
*   The file `apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` saw two updates (timestamps: **8:07:02 PM** and **8:07:09 PM**). The latter corrected a typo in a text assertion from "Complete your action a" to "Complete your action items", indicating a refinement in test case accuracy.

The `libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart` file, defining event classes for a search content screen, was updated on **November 13, 2025**.
*   Initially (timestamp: **7:06:42 PM**), the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` event class was defined without requiring a `searchText` parameter in its constructor.
*   A subsequent update (timestamp: **7:06:48 PM**) modified `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` to explicitly require `searchText` in its constructor, suggesting a change in how the initial view creation event is handled, now always expecting a search query.

Several `AndroidManifest.xml` files across different applications were modified on **November 17, 2025**, primarily related to Android permissions.
*   For `apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, multiple changes occurred between **6:16 PM and 6:20 PM**. Initial permissions included `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, and various `BLUETOOTH` permissions. A key update at **6:18:00 PM** added comments clarifying that `RECORD_AUDIO` and related Bluetooth permissions are specifically for a "speech-to-text" feature. There were also transient changes involving duplicate permission declarations that were subsequently removed by **6:20:24 PM**, leaving the permissions correctly declared with explanatory comments.
*   For `apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, the file consistently included `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with queries for `android.content.Intent.ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT` and `android.speech.RecognitionService` across multiple timestamps between **7:21 PM and 7:26 PM**. No functional changes were observed in this file during these updates, suggesting minor saves or checks.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **API Documentation Focus**: A significant effort was made to document Asset APIs, highlighting development or formalization of backend interactions.
*   **BDD Testing Adoption**: The introduction and refinement of BDD test steps indicate a commitment to behavior-driven development and robust testing practices for the mobile application's UI.
*   **Speech-to-Text Integration**: Consistent presence and explicit comments regarding `RECORD_AUDIO` and speech recognition services in `AndroidManifest.xml` files across different apps suggest ongoing integration or enhancement of speech-to-text capabilities within Freshservice mobile applications.
*   **Event-Driven UI Architecture**: The updates to `SearchContentScreenEvent` demonstrate a structured approach to managing UI events, with careful consideration for required data during event emission.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: Several files show very close timestamps for multiple changes, indicating quick iterative updates, typo fixes, or minor structural adjustments within a short development window.

## 1:55:01 AM
The `freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` file underwent updates around November 12, 2025, 7:23 PM. This Markdown file serves as comprehensive documentation for Asset APIs, detailing both V2 and V1 endpoints. The V2 APIs section is particularly elaborate, outlining methods, paths, query parameters, and example request/response structures for operations like getting associated assets, searching assets, managing asset types, attaching/detaching assets to tickets and changes, fetching main and CI type fields, retrieving vendor details, and full CRUD (Create, Read, Update) for assets. The `Create Asset V2` (POST) and `Edit Asset V2` (PUT) endpoints are documented with extensive JSON payloads, showcasing a wide range of asset properties and type-specific fields. There were two log entries for this file within a short timeframe (7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM), with seemingly identical content provided, suggesting either a re-save or minor, uncaptured formatting changes.

In the `apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` file, a new BDD step function `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage` was added on November 12, 2025, 7:59 PM. This function facilitates testing by setting up the Flutter tester's view to simulate an iPhone 11 and navigating the application to the `/support` route.

The `apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` file saw two quick updates on November 12, 2025, at 8:07 PM. Initially, a BDD step function `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage` was added to assert the presence of specific UI elements (like notification and logo images, and various text labels such as 'Report issue', 'Request service', 'Browse help articles') on the support homepage. A subsequent minor update seconds later corrected a typo in one of the asserted text labels, changing 'Complete your action a' to 'Complete your action items'.

The `libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart` file was updated twice on November 13, 2025, around 7:06 PM. This file defines a `sealed class SearchContentScreenEvent` and its various subclasses, representing events within a search content screen. These events include `ViewCreated`, `SearchTextChanged`, `ResetPagingState`, `LoadSearchResults`, `ClickSearchItem`, and `NavigationHandled`. The initial update introduced these events, and a quick follow-up corrected the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor to explicitly require a `searchText` parameter, aligning it with its field.

Multiple updates occurred to Android Manifest files on November 17, 2025.
The `apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file saw several changes and reverts between 6:16 PM and 6:20 PM. Common elements across these changes include `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions. The `<queries>` section consistently includes intents for `ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT` and `android.speech.RecognitionService`. A brief period saw comments added to explain permissions for speech-to-text features, and a temporary duplication of Bluetooth and audio permissions, but these were subsequently removed, reverting the file to a state without these additional comments or duplicated permissions.
Similarly, the `apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file was logged multiple times between 7:21 PM and 7:26 PM, with each entry containing identical content. This manifest consistently includes `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with the `ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT` and `android.speech.RecognitionService` intents in its `<queries>` section.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Dates:** All logged changes occurred in November 2025, suggesting a period of focused development.
*   **API Documentation Detail:** The `asset.md` file demonstrates a strong emphasis on providing detailed API contract documentation, especially for V2 endpoints, including request methods, paths, parameters, and comprehensive payload examples.
*   **BDD Testing:** The `fsmodule` application actively uses BDD for testing UI navigation and the presence of critical elements on its support pages.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** The `SearchContentScreenEvent` definitions indicate a clear event-driven pattern for managing state and interactions within search-related UI components.
*   **Android Permissions and Features:** Across both `fsmodule` and `fs_ui_catalog_app` Android manifests, `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions are consistently present, along with queries for `android.speech.RecognitionService`. This strongly suggests that speech-to-text functionality is a core or intended feature for these applications, relying on microphone access and internet connectivity. Bluetooth permissions are also consistently present for the `fsmodule` app.
*   **Flutter Integration:** The `flutterEmbedding` metadata and references to `io.flutter.plugin.text.ProcessTextPlugin` confirm that these are Flutter applications, utilizing standard Flutter build configurations for Android.

## 3:23:33 AM
The changes log details updates across documentation, BDD test steps, a Flutter event model, and Android Manifest files for two different Flutter applications.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` (Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM)**: This file provides extensive documentation for Asset APIs, covering both V2 and V1 versions. It details various endpoints for associated assets, asset listing and searching, asset types, attaching/detaching assets, retrieving main and CI type fields, vendor and product information, and creating/editing assets. No functional change was observed between the two recorded timestamps for this file, indicating a re-save or minor, uncaptured formatting change.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` (Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM)**: A new BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) test step was added. This step, `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`, is responsible for setting up the test environment (device size and pixel ratio) and navigating the `FSModuleAppWidget` to the `/support` route, then settling the widget tree.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` (Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM and 8:07:09 PM)**: A BDD test step for verifying navigation to the support homepage was updated. The change involved correcting a typo in one of the asserted text strings: "Complete your action a" was updated to "Complete your action items".

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart` (Timestamp: 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM and 7:06:48 PM)**: A subtle but important update was made to the `SearchContentScreenEvent` sealed class. Specifically, the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor was modified to make the `searchText` parameter `required`, ensuring that an initial search text must always be provided when this event is created.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (Timestamp: 11/17/2025, from 6:16:41 PM to 6:20:24 PM)**: This file saw several rapid updates and reverts. Initially, comments explaining the `INTERNET` permission for development and a block detailing permissions for speech-to-text were added. These comments were then removed and re-added, leading to a temporary duplication of `RECORD_AUDIO` and `BLUETOOTH` related permissions. By the final timestamp (6:20:24 PM), the file largely reverted to its state at 6:16:41 PM, consistently declaring `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions, along with `queries` for `PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (Timestamp: 11/17/2025, from 7:21:56 PM to 7:26:12 PM)**: This Android Manifest file remained consistent across all recorded timestamps. It declares `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, specifies the `MainActivity` configuration, `flutterEmbedding` metadata, and includes `queries` for `PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`. Unlike the `fsmodule` manifest, it does not explicitly list Bluetooth-related permissions in these entries.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM**: Creation of a new BDD step for support homepage navigation.
*   **11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM**: Correction of a typo in an existing BDD test assertion.
*   **11/13/2025, 7:06:48 PM**: Enforcement of a required parameter in a search event model, indicating stricter data validation.
*   **11/17/2025, 6:18:00 PM and 6:20:09 PM**: Attempts to add detailed comments and subsequent permission duplication/reversion in `fsmodule`'s AndroidManifest, indicating active configuration adjustments for speech-to-text.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on API Documentation and Testing:** There's a clear emphasis on documenting existing API endpoints (Asset APIs) and ensuring UI functionality through BDD tests.
*   **Refinement of Flutter Event Models:** The change in `SearchContentScreenEvent` points to ongoing development and stricter typing/data requirements within the application's event-driven architecture.
*   **Android Manifest Configuration for Speech-to-Text:** Multiple changes across two Android Manifest files (`fsmodule` and `fs_ui_catalog_app`) consistently involve `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions and `android.speech.RecognitionService` queries. This pattern strongly suggests a continuous effort to integrate, refine, or troubleshoot speech-to-text functionality within the Freshservice mobile applications. The rapid reverts and re-additions in `fsmodule`'s manifest particularly highlight an iterative process of finding the correct or most concise permission declarations.

## 5:22:52 AM
The provided log details recent code changes across several files related to Freshservice mobile applications. Key updates include:

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM.
    *   This Markdown file, documenting Asset API endpoints, received a comprehensive update. It outlines both V1 and V2 APIs for managing assets. The V2 section details various operations like getting associated assets for tickets/changes, searching assets, listing asset types, attaching/detaching assets, retrieving main and CI type fields, vendor/product info, and creating/editing assets. Detailed examples of API paths, query parameters, and JSON payloads (for Create/Edit Asset V2) are provided. The two entries within seconds of each other suggest a minor re-save or insignificant change not visible in the content.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM.
    *   A BDD test step (`iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`) was created or updated. It configures the Flutter widget tester to simulate an iPhone 11 and pumps the `FSModuleAppWidget` with an initial route to "/support", indicating a test setup for the support homepage.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM and 8:07:09 PM.
    *   This BDD test step (`iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage`) was updated. Initially, it asserted the presence of "Complete your action a" text on the support homepage. A quick follow-up change corrected this text assertion to "Complete your action items", indicating a minor refinement to the expected UI text in the test. Other assertions for notifications icon, FS Logo, and "Hi, how can we help you?", "Report issue", "Request service", and "Browse help articles" remained constant.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM and 7:06:48 PM.
    *   The `SearchContentScreenEvent` sealed class, which defines various events for the search content screen, was modified. Specifically, the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` event now explicitly requires the `searchText` parameter to be passed, enforcing its presence during the event's creation.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Multiple changes between 11/17/2025, 6:16:41 PM and 6:20:24 PM.
    *   The Android Manifest file for the `fsmodule` application underwent several modifications, primarily focused on clarifying and managing permissions. While the core permissions (`INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`) remained consistent throughout the changes, comments were added and refined to explicitly state that the audio-related permissions are "Required for speech-to-text feature" and that `INTERNET` is also "Required for Flutter development tools (hot reload, debugging)". A temporary duplication of the speech-to-text permissions was introduced at 6:20:09 PM but swiftly corrected by 6:20:24 PM.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Multiple changes between 11/17/2025, 7:21:56 PM and 7:26:12 PM.
    *   The Android Manifest for the `fs_ui_catalog_app` was present in the logs across several timestamps. The content, including `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, and queries for `ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`, remained identical across all logged entries. This indicates minor re-saves or formatting changes without functional impact.

**Patterns and recurring elements:**

*   **Rapid Iteration/Refinement:** Several files (`asset.md`, `i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`, `search_content_screen_event.dart`, and both `AndroidManifest.xml` files) show multiple log entries within a very short timeframe (seconds to a few minutes). This suggests active development, quick fixes, or minor re-saves/formatting changes.
*   **Android Permissions and Speech-to-Text:** There's a clear focus on reviewing and documenting Android permissions, particularly `RECORD_AUDIO` and `BLUETOOTH` related permissions, with explicit comments linking them to a "speech-to-text" feature in the `fsmodule` app. The presence of `android.speech.RecognitionService` in the `<queries>` block of both Android manifests reinforces this.
*   **Test Development:** BDD test steps for navigating to and verifying the support homepage are being developed and refined, indicating ongoing work on feature testing.
*   **API Documentation:** Detailed API documentation for Asset management (V1 and V2) is being maintained, suggesting active development or refinement of backend integrations related to assets.
*   **Flutter Development:** The changes span across Flutter app modules (`fsmodule`, `fs_ui_catalog_app`) and shared libraries (`fs_lib/common_ui`), indicating active development within the Flutter ecosystem.

## 6:23:32 AM
The provided log details code changes across various components of a Freshservice mobile Flutter project, focusing on API documentation, BDD test steps, search feature events, and Android manifest configurations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM
    *   This markdown file serves as extensive documentation for Freshservice Asset APIs. It outlines a multitude of V2 and V1 endpoints, covering operations such as listing, searching, creating, editing, attaching, and detaching assets, retrieving asset types, main fields, CI type fields, vendor details, and products. Each API entry details the method (GET, PUT, POST), path, query parameters, example payloads, and links to JSON response bodies. The content remained identical between the two timestamps, including a truncated payload for the "Edit Asset V2" section.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM
    *   A BDD test step was added or modified. This step, `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`, configures the `WidgetTester` for an iPhone 11, pumps the `FSModuleAppWidget` with `/support` as the initial route, and waits for 10 seconds, simulating navigation to the support home page for testing.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM
    *   **Significant Change:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM
    *   This BDD test step, `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage`, was initially defined to assert the presence of specific UI elements (images like `icNotifications`, `icFSLogo` and text strings such as 'Hi, how can we help you?', 'Report issue', 'Request service', 'Complete your action a', 'Browse help articles') on the support homepage. A quick follow-up change corrected a typo in a text assertion from `'Complete your action a'` to `'Complete your action items'`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM
    *   **Significant Change:** 11/13/2025, 7:06:48 PM
    *   This file defines sealed class `SearchContentScreenEvent` and its various sub-events related to a search content screen (e.g., `ViewCreated`, `SearchTextChanged`, `ResetPagingState`, `LoadSearchResults`, `ClickSearchItem`, `NavigationHandled`). The primary change involved modifying the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` event to require a `searchText` parameter in its constructor, making it mandatory to pass the search text when the view is created.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/17/2025, 6:16:41 PM, 6:18:00 PM, 6:18:28 PM, 6:18:43 PM, 6:20:09 PM, 6:20:24 PM
    *   This Android Manifest file for the `fsmodule` app shows significant churn over a short period.
        *   It initially contained `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, and `BLUETOOTH` related permissions, along with `queries` for text processing and speech recognition services.
        *   A change at 6:18:00 PM added detailed comments explaining the purpose of these permissions, specifically linking them to speech-to-text functionality.
        *   These comments were then removed (6:18:28 PM, 6:18:43 PM), reverting to the earlier state without explanatory comments.
        *   Subsequently, at 6:20:09 PM, the comments were re-added, and, notably, the `RECORD_AUDIO` and `BLUETOOTH` permissions were **duplicated** within the manifest.
        *   Finally, at 6:20:24 PM, the duplicated permissions and the detailed comments were removed, effectively reverting the file to a state similar to the initial 6:16:41 PM version, but without the specific comments for speech-to-text.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/17/2025, 7:21:56 PM, 7:25:54 PM, 7:26:12 PM
    *   This Android Manifest file for the `fs_ui_catalog_app` consistently includes `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, standard Flutter activity declarations, and `queries` for `ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`. The content remained identical across all three timestamps, suggesting re-saves without functional changes or very minor, unlogged alterations.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Flutter Project Structure:** The paths consistently indicate a large Flutter project (`mobile_flutter_freshservice`) with distinct modules like `apps/fsmodule`, `libraries/fs_lib/common_ui`, and `apps/fs_ui_catalog_app`.
*   **API Documentation:** There's a dedicated `documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` for comprehensive API descriptions, including both V1 and V2 versions, suggesting ongoing API development and maintenance.
*   **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** The presence of `bdd_steps` directories highlights the use of BDD for testing UI flows, particularly for the support portal.
*   **Search Feature Development:** The `search_content_screen_event.dart` file points to active development or refinement of a search functionality, defining clear events for its lifecycle.
*   **Android Permissions and Speech-to-Text:** Both Android Manifest files consistently declare `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with `queries` for `android.speech.RecognitionService`. This strongly suggests that speech-to-text or voice interaction capabilities are a common requirement across different parts of the Freshservice mobile application.
*   **Configuration Churn:** The rapid sequence of additions, removals, re-additions, and duplications of comments and permissions in `fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` indicates active experimentation, debugging, or indecision regarding manifest configurations, especially around the speech-to-text feature.

## 7:24:24 AM
The provided log details changes across three main areas: API documentation for Assets, BDD test steps for a support module, and Android manifest file updates across two Flutter applications.

    *   **Changes:** This markdown file comprehensively documents Asset APIs, categorizing them into V1 and V2 APIs. It details various endpoints for managing assets, including:
        *   **Retrieval:** `Associated Assets`, `Get And Search Assets List`, `Get Assets List For Asset Type`, `Asset Types`, `Search Asset`, `Get Main Fields V2`, `Get CI Type Fields V2`, `Get Asset Association List`, `Get Vendor Details`, `Get Product Vendor Info`, `Get Products`, `Search Products`, `Get Asset List V1`, `Get Asset Detail`, `Get Asset Form`, `Get Ci Type Fields`.
        *   **Modification:** `Attach Asset`, `Attach Asset to Change`, `Detach Asset`, `Detach Asset from Change`, `Create Asset V2`, `Edit Asset V2`, `Create Asset`, `Update Asset`, `Update Last Audit Date`.
    *   Each API endpoint includes details such as `Method` (GET, PUT, POST), `Path`, `QueryParams`, `Payload` (for PUT/POST), and links to mock JSON responses.
    *   The content across the two timestamps is virtually identical, suggesting a minor save or reformat without functional changes to the documented API endpoints or their examples.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM.
    *   **Changes:** A new BDD step definition `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage` was added. This Flutter test utility sets the tester's view size to an iPhone 11, pumps the `FSModuleAppWidget` with an `initialRoute` of "/support", and waits for the UI to settle.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart**
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM and 11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM.
    *   **Changes:** This BDD step `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage` asserts the presence of specific UI elements on the support homepage, including `icNotifications`, `icFSLogo` (images), and several text labels like 'Hi, how can we help you?', 'Report issue', 'Request service', 'Browse help articles'.
    *   A minor update occurred at the later timestamp: the text assertion `Complete your action a` was corrected to `Complete your action items`.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart**
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM and 11/13/2025, 7:06:48 PM.
    *   **Changes:** This file defines sealed classes for `SearchContentScreenEvent`, representing various events in a search content screen. Events include `ViewCreated`, `SearchTextChanged`, `ResetPagingState`, `LoadSearchResults`, `ClickSearchItem`, and `NavigationHandled`.
    *   A significant change occurred to `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated`: its constructor was updated from `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated()` to `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated({required this.searchText});`, making `searchText` a required parameter for the event when the view is created.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/17/2025, 6:16:41 PM, 6:18:00 PM, 6:18:28 PM, 6:18:43 PM, 6:20:09 PM, 6:20:24 PM.
    *   **Changes:** Multiple small updates to Android permissions and comments.
        *   Initially, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions were added.
        *   Later, a comment was added explaining the purpose of these permissions, specifically for the speech-to-text feature.
        *   The permissions `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` were duplicated in one of the updates (11/17/2025, 6:20:09 PM) and then corrected (removed duplicates) in the subsequent update (11/17/2025, 6:20:24 PM).
        *   The `queries` section consistently includes intents for `android.intent.action.PROCESS_TEXT` and `android.speech.RecognitionService`, supporting text processing and speech recognition features.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/17/2025, 7:21:56 PM, 7:25:54 PM, 7:26:12 PM.
    *   **Changes:** This Android manifest for `fs_ui_catalog_app` was updated to include `RECORD_AUDIO` permission, in addition to the existing `INTERNET` permission.
    *   The `queries` section for `android.intent.action.PROCESS_TEXT` and `android.speech.RecognitionService` was also added, mirroring the changes in `fsmodule`'s manifest.
    *   The content remained consistent across the latter two timestamps, indicating a minor save or reformat.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   **11/12/2025, 7:23 PM:** Extensive documentation of Asset APIs (V1 and V2) was present and minorly adjusted.
*   **11/12/2025, 7:59 PM - 8:07 PM:** Introduction and refinement of BDD test steps for navigating and asserting the support home page.
*   **11/13/2025, 7:06 PM:** A structural change to `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` by adding a required `searchText` parameter.
*   **11/17/2025, 6:16 PM - 6:20 PM:** Consecutive updates to `fsmodule`'s AndroidManifest.xml, primarily adding and then clarifying audio/Bluetooth related permissions, with a brief duplication error fixed quickly.
*   **11/17/2025, 7:21 PM - 7:26 PM:** Updates to `fs_ui_catalog_app`'s AndroidManifest.xml, adding audio recording permission and `queries` for speech recognition.

**Patterns and recurring elements:**

*   **Flutter Project Structure:** The file paths indicate a monorepo-like structure for a Freshservice mobile Flutter application, with `apps` for distinct applications (`fsmodule`, `fs_ui_catalog_app`) and `libraries` for shared components (`fs_lib/common_ui`). Documentation is also part of the codebase (`documentation/responses/asset`).
*   **API Documentation:** There's a strong emphasis on documenting API endpoints with consistent format (Method, Path, QueryParams, Payload, Response links).
*   **BDD Testing:** Usage of BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) steps (`i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`, `i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`) suggests a testing methodology focused on user behavior.
*   **Android Permissions:** A recurring theme on 11/17/2025 is the addition of `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions and `android.speech.RecognitionService` intent queries in `AndroidManifest.xml` files across multiple apps. This strongly implies the integration or enhancement of a speech-to-text or voice interaction feature within Freshservice mobile applications.
*   **Minor Adjustments:** Several logs show very minor changes (e.g., text correction in BDD steps, slight reordering/formatting, or quick corrections of duplicated lines in XML), indicating active development and iterative refinement.
*   **Timestamp Trend:** Changes are clustered by logical areas: documentation/API on 11/12, BDD tests on 11/12, search event models on 11/13, and Android manifest permissions on 11/17. This suggests focused work sessions on different aspects of the project.

## 10:27:34 AM
The provided log details recent code changes across several files within the Freshservice mobile Flutter project, primarily focusing on API documentation, UI testing, event handling, and Android manifest configurations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 11/12/2025, 7:23:30 PM**
    *   This file contains extensive Markdown documentation for Freshservice Asset APIs, covering both V1 and V2 endpoints. It details methods (GET, PUT, POST), paths, query parameters, payload examples for creating and editing assets, and references to JSON response bodies. The documented APIs allow operations such as getting and searching asset lists, associating and detaching assets from tickets and changes, managing asset types, fields (Main and CI Type), vendor details, and product information. The second entry, occurring just 19 seconds after the first, appears to be a minor update or completion of the `Edit Asset V2` API documentation, as indicated by the truncated content of the first entry.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM**
    *   A new BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) test step, `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`, was added. This step initializes the Flutter test environment, setting the tester's view to simulate an iPhone 11 device and navigating the `FSModuleAppWidget` to the `/support` route, then waiting for the UI to settle.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM and 11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM**
    *   Another BDD test step, `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage`, was updated. It asserts the presence of key UI elements (notification and FS logo images, various text labels like "Hi, how can we help you?", "Report issue", "Request service", "Browse help articles") to verify successful navigation to the support homepage. A rapid follow-up change corrected a typo in one of the asserted text labels, from "Complete your action a" to "Complete your action items".

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM and 11/13/2025, 7:06:48 PM**
    *   This file defines a `sealed class` `SearchContentScreenEvent` and its subclasses, representing various events for a search content screen (e.g., `ViewCreated`, `SearchTextChanged`, `LoadSearchResults`). Initially, the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor did not require a `searchText`. A subsequent change, occurring just 6 seconds later, modified this constructor to *require* the `searchText` parameter.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/17/2025, 6:16:41 PM to 11/17/2025, 6:20:24 PM**
    *   This Android Manifest underwent several rapid modifications related to permissions and comments. It consistently includes `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions. There was a temporary addition of a detailed comment explaining these permissions (especially for speech-to-text functionality), followed by its removal, re-addition, and a brief period where `RECORD_AUDIO` and Bluetooth permissions were duplicated before being corrected. The final state after these quick changes includes the set of permissions and explanatory comments, without duplicates.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/17/2025, 7:21:56 PM to 11/17/2025, 7:26:12 PM**
    *   This Android Manifest consistently includes `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions. It also specifies `<queries>` for `android.intent.action.PROCESS_TEXT` and `android.speech.RecognitionService` intents. The multiple timestamps for this file show identical content, indicating a stable configuration after its initial setup or a series of saves without functional changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **BDD Testing Development:** There's a clear pattern of implementing and refining BDD test steps (`i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`, `i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`) for the support portal, suggesting active work on automated UI testing for the Freshservice mobile application.
*   **Speech-to-Text Integration:** Repeated additions and detailed comments around `RECORD_AUDIO` and `android.speech.RecognitionService` permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` files for both `fsmodule` and `fs_ui_catalog_app` strongly indicate the integration or enhancement of speech-to-text capabilities across the applications.
*   **API Documentation Maintenance:** The extensive `asset.md` file highlights continuous effort in documenting the application's API endpoints, which is crucial for development and maintenance.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** The definition of a sealed class for search screen events points to a structured, event-driven approach for managing UI state and logic within the application.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** Several files show very short intervals between timestamps (seconds to minutes), suggesting an agile development process with frequent, small commits for corrections, refinements, or minor additions.
*   **Future Timestamps:** All timestamps in the log are set in November 2025, which is a noteworthy characteristic of the log data itself.

## 11:27:25 AM
**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md`**
This file, updated on 11/12/2025 at 7:23:11 PM and again at 7:23:30 PM, serves as a comprehensive documentation for Asset APIs. It details various V2 and V1 API endpoints related to assets, including:
*   **V2 APIs:** Associated Assets (for tickets and changes), Get and Search Assets, Get Assets List for Asset Type, Asset Types, Search Asset (by user ID, asset type), Attach/Detach Asset (to tickets and changes), Get Main Fields, Get CI Type Fields, Get Asset Association List, Get Vendor Details, Get Product Vendor Info, Create Asset V2, and Edit Asset V2.
*   **V1 APIs:** Get Asset List V1, Get Asset Detail, Get Asset Form, Get Ci Type Fields, Create Asset, Update Asset, and Update Last Audit Date.
Each endpoint specifies the HTTP method, path, query parameters, and example JSON responses. The content for the "Edit Asset V2" section is consistently truncated in both log entries. The second timestamp shows identical content to the first, suggesting a re-save or a continuous log of a single, larger change where the initial content was captured.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`**
On 11/12/2025 at 7:59:04 PM, a new BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) step function `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage` was added. This function facilitates UI testing by setting the tester's view to simulate an iPhone 11 and navigating the `FSModuleAppWidget` to the `/support` route, ensuring the UI settles before further interactions.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`**
This BDD step function was initially created on 11/12/2025 at 8:07:02 PM to verify navigation to the support homepage. It asserts the presence of specific UI elements like notification and Freshservice logo images, and text elements such as "Hi, how can we help you?", "Report issue", "Request service", "Complete your action a", and "Browse help articles". A quick follow-up change at 8:07:09 PM on the same day corrected a typo in the text assertion from "Complete your action a" to "Complete your action items".

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart`**
On 11/13/2025, this file saw two updates. At 7:06:42 PM, a sealed class `SearchContentScreenEvent` was defined along with several subclasses representing different events for a search content screen (e.g., `ViewCreated`, `SearchTextChanged`, `LoadSearchResults`). A minor correction was made at 7:06:48 PM, updating the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor to explicitly require the `searchText` parameter, aligning it with the class's property declaration.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
This Android Manifest file underwent several changes on 11/17/2025, primarily related to permissions.
*   Initially (6:16:41 PM), it included `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions, and defined queries for `ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`.
*   At 6:18:00 PM, comments were added to existing permissions, explicitly stating their necessity for "speech-to-text" functionality.
*   Subsequent entries at 6:18:28 PM and 6:18:43 PM show the content reverting to the state without these explanatory comments, suggesting either accidental reverts or re-saves.
*   At 6:20:09 PM, the comments were re-introduced, but this update also duplicated the `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permission entries.
*   Finally, at 6:20:24 PM, the duplicate permission entries were removed, resulting in a clean manifest with the explanatory comments for the speech-to-text related permissions.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
This Android Manifest file for the UI catalog app was logged three times on 11/17/2025 (7:21:56 PM, 7:25:54 PM, 7:26:12 PM). All entries show identical content, including `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with queries for `ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`. This indicates a consistent setup for these permissions, likely to support features similar to those in the `fsmodule` app.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The log indicates active development within a Flutter project (`mobile_flutter_freshservice`). A significant pattern is the ongoing maintenance and expansion of API documentation, distinguishing between V1 and V2 APIs, suggesting a transition or parallel support for different API versions. There's a clear focus on enhancing testing capabilities through BDD steps, as seen with the introduction and refinement of UI test functions. A prominent recurring theme across the Android applications (`fsmodule` and `fs_ui_catalog_app`) is the integration and configuration of speech-to-text functionality, evidenced by the consistent addition and refinement of `RECORD_AUDIO` and `RecognitionService` permissions in their `AndroidManifest.xml` files. Minor corrections and cleanups in code and test assertions highlight an iterative development process.
