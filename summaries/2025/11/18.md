# Activity Summary for 11/18/2025

## 12:26:33 AM
The `freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` file received significant updates around **November 12, 2025, 7:23 PM**. This file provides comprehensive documentation for Asset APIs, detailing both V2 and V1 endpoints. It covers a wide range of functionalities including getting and searching assets, managing associated assets for tickets and changes, handling asset types, attaching/detaching assets, retrieving main and CI type fields, vendor and product information, and creating/editing assets. The documentation specifies API methods (GET, PUT, POST), paths, query parameters, payload examples, and references to JSON response bodies, indicating a robust effort to document API interactions.

BDD test steps for the support module were introduced and refined on **November 12, 2025**.
*   The file `apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` (timestamp: **7:59:04 PM**) adds a test step to set up the environment for the support home page, including setting device dimensions (iPhone 11) and pumping the `FSModuleAppWidget`.
*   The file `apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` saw two updates (timestamps: **8:07:02 PM** and **8:07:09 PM**). The latter corrected a typo in a text assertion from "Complete your action a" to "Complete your action items", indicating a refinement in test case accuracy.

The `libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart` file, defining event classes for a search content screen, was updated on **November 13, 2025**.
*   Initially (timestamp: **7:06:42 PM**), the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` event class was defined without requiring a `searchText` parameter in its constructor.
*   A subsequent update (timestamp: **7:06:48 PM**) modified `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` to explicitly require `searchText` in its constructor, suggesting a change in how the initial view creation event is handled, now always expecting a search query.

Several `AndroidManifest.xml` files across different applications were modified on **November 17, 2025**, primarily related to Android permissions.
*   For `apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, multiple changes occurred between **6:16 PM and 6:20 PM**. Initial permissions included `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, and various `BLUETOOTH` permissions. A key update at **6:18:00 PM** added comments clarifying that `RECORD_AUDIO` and related Bluetooth permissions are specifically for a "speech-to-text" feature. There were also transient changes involving duplicate permission declarations that were subsequently removed by **6:20:24 PM**, leaving the permissions correctly declared with explanatory comments.
*   For `apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, the file consistently included `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with queries for `android.content.Intent.ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT` and `android.speech.RecognitionService` across multiple timestamps between **7:21 PM and 7:26 PM**. No functional changes were observed in this file during these updates, suggesting minor saves or checks.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **API Documentation Focus**: A significant effort was made to document Asset APIs, highlighting development or formalization of backend interactions.
*   **BDD Testing Adoption**: The introduction and refinement of BDD test steps indicate a commitment to behavior-driven development and robust testing practices for the mobile application's UI.
*   **Speech-to-Text Integration**: Consistent presence and explicit comments regarding `RECORD_AUDIO` and speech recognition services in `AndroidManifest.xml` files across different apps suggest ongoing integration or enhancement of speech-to-text capabilities within Freshservice mobile applications.
*   **Event-Driven UI Architecture**: The updates to `SearchContentScreenEvent` demonstrate a structured approach to managing UI events, with careful consideration for required data during event emission.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: Several files show very close timestamps for multiple changes, indicating quick iterative updates, typo fixes, or minor structural adjustments within a short development window.

## 1:55:01 AM
The `freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` file underwent updates around November 12, 2025, 7:23 PM. This Markdown file serves as comprehensive documentation for Asset APIs, detailing both V2 and V1 endpoints. The V2 APIs section is particularly elaborate, outlining methods, paths, query parameters, and example request/response structures for operations like getting associated assets, searching assets, managing asset types, attaching/detaching assets to tickets and changes, fetching main and CI type fields, retrieving vendor details, and full CRUD (Create, Read, Update) for assets. The `Create Asset V2` (POST) and `Edit Asset V2` (PUT) endpoints are documented with extensive JSON payloads, showcasing a wide range of asset properties and type-specific fields. There were two log entries for this file within a short timeframe (7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM), with seemingly identical content provided, suggesting either a re-save or minor, uncaptured formatting changes.

In the `apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` file, a new BDD step function `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage` was added on November 12, 2025, 7:59 PM. This function facilitates testing by setting up the Flutter tester's view to simulate an iPhone 11 and navigating the application to the `/support` route.

The `apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` file saw two quick updates on November 12, 2025, at 8:07 PM. Initially, a BDD step function `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage` was added to assert the presence of specific UI elements (like notification and logo images, and various text labels such as 'Report issue', 'Request service', 'Browse help articles') on the support homepage. A subsequent minor update seconds later corrected a typo in one of the asserted text labels, changing 'Complete your action a' to 'Complete your action items'.

The `libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart` file was updated twice on November 13, 2025, around 7:06 PM. This file defines a `sealed class SearchContentScreenEvent` and its various subclasses, representing events within a search content screen. These events include `ViewCreated`, `SearchTextChanged`, `ResetPagingState`, `LoadSearchResults`, `ClickSearchItem`, and `NavigationHandled`. The initial update introduced these events, and a quick follow-up corrected the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor to explicitly require a `searchText` parameter, aligning it with its field.

Multiple updates occurred to Android Manifest files on November 17, 2025.
The `apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file saw several changes and reverts between 6:16 PM and 6:20 PM. Common elements across these changes include `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions. The `<queries>` section consistently includes intents for `ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT` and `android.speech.RecognitionService`. A brief period saw comments added to explain permissions for speech-to-text features, and a temporary duplication of Bluetooth and audio permissions, but these were subsequently removed, reverting the file to a state without these additional comments or duplicated permissions.
Similarly, the `apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file was logged multiple times between 7:21 PM and 7:26 PM, with each entry containing identical content. This manifest consistently includes `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with the `ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT` and `android.speech.RecognitionService` intents in its `<queries>` section.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Dates:** All logged changes occurred in November 2025, suggesting a period of focused development.
*   **API Documentation Detail:** The `asset.md` file demonstrates a strong emphasis on providing detailed API contract documentation, especially for V2 endpoints, including request methods, paths, parameters, and comprehensive payload examples.
*   **BDD Testing:** The `fsmodule` application actively uses BDD for testing UI navigation and the presence of critical elements on its support pages.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** The `SearchContentScreenEvent` definitions indicate a clear event-driven pattern for managing state and interactions within search-related UI components.
*   **Android Permissions and Features:** Across both `fsmodule` and `fs_ui_catalog_app` Android manifests, `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions are consistently present, along with queries for `android.speech.RecognitionService`. This strongly suggests that speech-to-text functionality is a core or intended feature for these applications, relying on microphone access and internet connectivity. Bluetooth permissions are also consistently present for the `fsmodule` app.
*   **Flutter Integration:** The `flutterEmbedding` metadata and references to `io.flutter.plugin.text.ProcessTextPlugin` confirm that these are Flutter applications, utilizing standard Flutter build configurations for Android.

## 3:23:33 AM
The changes log details updates across documentation, BDD test steps, a Flutter event model, and Android Manifest files for two different Flutter applications.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` (Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM)**: This file provides extensive documentation for Asset APIs, covering both V2 and V1 versions. It details various endpoints for associated assets, asset listing and searching, asset types, attaching/detaching assets, retrieving main and CI type fields, vendor and product information, and creating/editing assets. No functional change was observed between the two recorded timestamps for this file, indicating a re-save or minor, uncaptured formatting change.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` (Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM)**: A new BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) test step was added. This step, `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`, is responsible for setting up the test environment (device size and pixel ratio) and navigating the `FSModuleAppWidget` to the `/support` route, then settling the widget tree.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` (Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM and 8:07:09 PM)**: A BDD test step for verifying navigation to the support homepage was updated. The change involved correcting a typo in one of the asserted text strings: "Complete your action a" was updated to "Complete your action items".

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart` (Timestamp: 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM and 7:06:48 PM)**: A subtle but important update was made to the `SearchContentScreenEvent` sealed class. Specifically, the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor was modified to make the `searchText` parameter `required`, ensuring that an initial search text must always be provided when this event is created.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (Timestamp: 11/17/2025, from 6:16:41 PM to 6:20:24 PM)**: This file saw several rapid updates and reverts. Initially, comments explaining the `INTERNET` permission for development and a block detailing permissions for speech-to-text were added. These comments were then removed and re-added, leading to a temporary duplication of `RECORD_AUDIO` and `BLUETOOTH` related permissions. By the final timestamp (6:20:24 PM), the file largely reverted to its state at 6:16:41 PM, consistently declaring `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions, along with `queries` for `PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (Timestamp: 11/17/2025, from 7:21:56 PM to 7:26:12 PM)**: This Android Manifest file remained consistent across all recorded timestamps. It declares `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, specifies the `MainActivity` configuration, `flutterEmbedding` metadata, and includes `queries` for `PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`. Unlike the `fsmodule` manifest, it does not explicitly list Bluetooth-related permissions in these entries.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM**: Creation of a new BDD step for support homepage navigation.
*   **11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM**: Correction of a typo in an existing BDD test assertion.
*   **11/13/2025, 7:06:48 PM**: Enforcement of a required parameter in a search event model, indicating stricter data validation.
*   **11/17/2025, 6:18:00 PM and 6:20:09 PM**: Attempts to add detailed comments and subsequent permission duplication/reversion in `fsmodule`'s AndroidManifest, indicating active configuration adjustments for speech-to-text.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on API Documentation and Testing:** There's a clear emphasis on documenting existing API endpoints (Asset APIs) and ensuring UI functionality through BDD tests.
*   **Refinement of Flutter Event Models:** The change in `SearchContentScreenEvent` points to ongoing development and stricter typing/data requirements within the application's event-driven architecture.
*   **Android Manifest Configuration for Speech-to-Text:** Multiple changes across two Android Manifest files (`fsmodule` and `fs_ui_catalog_app`) consistently involve `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions and `android.speech.RecognitionService` queries. This pattern strongly suggests a continuous effort to integrate, refine, or troubleshoot speech-to-text functionality within the Freshservice mobile applications. The rapid reverts and re-additions in `fsmodule`'s manifest particularly highlight an iterative process of finding the correct or most concise permission declarations.
