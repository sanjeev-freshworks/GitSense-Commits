# Activity Summary for 11/15/2025

## 1:25:23 AM
The documentation file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` received two updates in quick succession on 11/12/2025 at 7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM. This file provides comprehensive documentation for Freshservice Asset APIs, covering both V1 and V2 endpoints. It details numerous API operations, including retrieving, searching, associating, detaching, creating, and editing assets. The documentation also covers asset types, CI type fields, vendor details, and product information. The content between the two timestamps appears identical, suggesting a re-save or a non-functional update.

A new BDD test step was added in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` on 11/12/2025 at 7:59:04 PM. This step, `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`, is designed to set up the test environment by initializing the `FSModuleAppWidget` to the `/support` route, simulating an iPhone 11 device view, and waiting for the UI to settle.

The BDD test file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` was modified twice on 11/12/2025, at 8:07:02 PM and 8:07:09 PM. This file defines the `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage` step, which asserts the presence of various UI elements and text strings expected on the support homepage (e.g., notification icon, FS logo, "Report issue", "Request service"). The change between the two timestamps corrected a minor typo in one of the asserted text strings, from "Complete your action a" to "Complete your action items".

The event definition file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart` saw two updates on 11/13/2025 at 7:06:42 PM and 7:06:48 PM. This file defines a `sealed class SearchContentScreenEvent` and its subclasses, representing various events for a search content screen (e.g., `ViewCreated`, `SearchTextChanged`, `LoadSearchResults`). The update involved modifying the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor to explicitly require a `searchText` parameter, changing it from an implicit constructor to `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated({required this.searchText});`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The changes highlight a focus on both API documentation and Flutter BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) testing within the `Freshservice` mobile project. There's a pattern of rapid, iterative changes, often involving minor corrections or parameter additions, as seen in the closely timed updates for the API documentation, BDD test assertions, and search event definitions. The BDD test files specifically showcase the use of `flutter_test` along with custom helper functions for UI assertion. The `asset.md` content indicates the project manages both V1 and V2 versions of its APIs.
