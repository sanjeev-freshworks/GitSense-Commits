# Activity Summary for 11/15/2025

## 1:25:23 AM
The documentation file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` received two updates in quick succession on 11/12/2025 at 7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM. This file provides comprehensive documentation for Freshservice Asset APIs, covering both V1 and V2 endpoints. It details numerous API operations, including retrieving, searching, associating, detaching, creating, and editing assets. The documentation also covers asset types, CI type fields, vendor details, and product information. The content between the two timestamps appears identical, suggesting a re-save or a non-functional update.

A new BDD test step was added in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` on 11/12/2025 at 7:59:04 PM. This step, `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`, is designed to set up the test environment by initializing the `FSModuleAppWidget` to the `/support` route, simulating an iPhone 11 device view, and waiting for the UI to settle.

The BDD test file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` was modified twice on 11/12/2025, at 8:07:02 PM and 8:07:09 PM. This file defines the `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage` step, which asserts the presence of various UI elements and text strings expected on the support homepage (e.g., notification icon, FS logo, "Report issue", "Request service"). The change between the two timestamps corrected a minor typo in one of the asserted text strings, from "Complete your action a" to "Complete your action items".

The event definition file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart` saw two updates on 11/13/2025 at 7:06:42 PM and 7:06:48 PM. This file defines a `sealed class SearchContentScreenEvent` and its subclasses, representing various events for a search content screen (e.g., `ViewCreated`, `SearchTextChanged`, `LoadSearchResults`). The update involved modifying the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor to explicitly require a `searchText` parameter, changing it from an implicit constructor to `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated({required this.searchText});`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The changes highlight a focus on both API documentation and Flutter BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) testing within the `Freshservice` mobile project. There's a pattern of rapid, iterative changes, often involving minor corrections or parameter additions, as seen in the closely timed updates for the API documentation, BDD test assertions, and search event definitions. The BDD test files specifically showcase the use of `flutter_test` along with custom helper functions for UI assertion. The `asset.md` content indicates the project manages both V1 and V2 versions of its APIs.

## 2:54:10 AM

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 11/12/2025, 7:23:30 PM**
    *   This markdown file contains comprehensive documentation for Freshservice Asset APIs, covering both V1 and V2 versions. It outlines numerous endpoints and their functionalities, including:
        *   Associated Assets (for tickets and changes)
        *   Get and Search Assets List (with query parameters for pagination, asset type, search terms)
        *   Get Assets List For Asset Type
        *   Asset Types listing
        *   Search Asset by user ID, asset type, or all assets
        *   Attach and Detach Assets (from tickets and changes)
        *   Get Main Fields V2 and Get CI Type Fields V2
        *   Get Asset Association List, Vendor Details, and Product Vendor Info
        *   Create and Edit Asset V2, with detailed JSON payload examples showcasing extensive fields like `name`, `asset_tag`, `asset_type_id`, `impact`, `description`, `end_of_life`, and many type-specific fields (e.g., `compute_type`, `vendor`, `warranty`, `acquisition_date`, `serial_number`, `cost`).
        *   It also references several V1 APIs like Get Asset Types, Get Asset List, Get Asset Detail, Get Asset Form, Get CI Type Fields, Create Asset, Update Asset, and Update Last Audit Date.
    *   The two timestamps are very close, indicating a save or minor adjustment to the documentation. The first entry for this file appeared to be truncated, and the second provides the full, identical content, implying a completion rather than a change.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM**
    *   This file introduces a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) test step, `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`. It sets up a Flutter widget test environment by defining the `tester.view` size (simulating an iPhone 11), and then pumps the `FSModuleAppWidget` configured to start at the "/support" route, pausing for 10 seconds to allow the UI to settle. This prepares the app for testing the support home page.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM and 11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM**
    *   This file defines another BDD test step, `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage`, which asserts the presence of specific UI elements on the support homepage. It verifies two images (`icNotifications`, `icFSLogo`) and several text strings: "Hi, how can we help you?", "Report issue", "Request service", "Complete your action a", and "Browse help articles".
    *   A minor but notable change occurred just seven seconds later: the text assertion "Complete your action a" was corrected to "Complete your action items", indicating a quick fix to align the test step with the exact expected UI text.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM and 11/13/2025, 7:06:48 PM**
    *   This file defines a `sealed class` `SearchContentScreenEvent` and several event classes for a search content screen, including:
        *   `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated`: For when the view is created.
        *   `SearchContentScreenEventSearchTextChanged`: For changes in the search text.
        *   `SearchContentScreenEventResetPagingState`: To reset pagination.
        *   `SearchContentScreenEventLoadSearchResults`: To load search results for a given page.
        *   `SearchContentScreenEventClickSearchItem`: For when a search item is clicked.
        *   `SearchContentScreenEventNavigationHandled`: For when navigation is processed.
    *   The primary change between the two timestamps was to the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor. Initially, it did not explicitly require the `searchText` field despite having one. The update six seconds later made `searchText` a `required` parameter in its constructor, ensuring that the initial search text is always provided upon view creation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Flutter Development Focus:** The log entries predominantly feature `.dart` files, confirming active development within a Flutter framework, specifically for a mobile application.
