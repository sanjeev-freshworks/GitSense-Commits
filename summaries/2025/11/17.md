# Activity Summary for 11/17/2025

## 2:14:31 AM
The code changes primarily involve documentation for Asset APIs, updates to BDD test steps for a support homepage, and modifications to an event model for a search content screen. All timestamps observed are from November 2025.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md`**
Across two very close timestamps, **11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM** and **11/12/2025, 7:23:30 PM**, this file remained consistent. It provides comprehensive Markdown documentation for Asset APIs, detailing both V2 and V1 endpoints. The documentation outlines API methods (GET, POST, PUT), paths, query parameters, request payloads (for Create/Edit Asset V2), and expected response structures (linking to JSON body files).
Key V2 APIs documented include:
*   Associated Assets for tickets and changes.
*   Get and Search Assets List, including by Asset Type.
*   Asset Type management and search functionalities (by user ID, asset type, all assets).
*   Operations to Attach and Detach Assets from tickets and changes.
*   Retrieval of Main Fields and CI Type Fields (V2).
*   Fetching Asset Association List, Vendor Details, and Product Vendor Info.
*   Creating and Editing Assets (V2).
Key V1 APIs include:
*   Get Asset Types, Asset List, Asset Detail, Asset Form, and CI Type Fields.
*   Creating, Updating Assets, and updating Last Audit Date.
The documentation provides example requests and references to mock response JSON files. Notably, the documentation for the "Edit Asset V2" section appears truncated in both entries.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`**
On **11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM**, this file was added or modified to define a BDD step `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`. This step configures a Flutter `WidgetTester` to simulate an iPhone 11 device, then pumps the `FSModuleAppWidget` with an `initialRoute` of "/support", waiting for the widget tree to settle. This is a setup step for testing the support home page.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`**
This file, defining the BDD step `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage`, saw a minor but important correction.
*   At **11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM**, the step asserted the presence of various UI elements including specific images and texts like 'Hi, how can we help you?', 'Report issue', 'Request service', 'Complete your action a', and 'Browse help articles'. There was a minor typo or incomplete string in "Complete your action a".
*   Just seven seconds later, at **11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM**, this was corrected. The assertion `iSeeText(tester, 'Complete your action a')` was updated to `iSeeText(tester, 'Complete your action items')`, resolving the incomplete phrase.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart`**
This file defines a sealed class `SearchContentScreenEvent` and its subclasses, representing various events within a search content screen.
*   At **11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM**, the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` event class was defined with a `searchText` field but an empty constructor `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated();`.
*   A subsequent change at **11/13/2025, 7:06:48 PM**, explicitly made the `searchText` parameter `required` in the constructor of `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated`, changing it to `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated({required this.searchText});`. This ensures that when a `ViewCreated` event is fired, the `searchText` is always provided.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Future Timestamps:** All log entries are dated in November 2025, indicating either a projected work timeline or an anomaly in the system clock used for logging.
*   **Flutter/Dart Development:** The file paths and content consistently point to a Flutter project, with `.dart` files and BDD widget testing, suggesting active development in a mobile application context.
*   **BDD Testing Practices:** The presence of `bdd_steps` directories and `i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` and `i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` files indicates a strong adoption of Behavior-Driven Development for testing UI interactions.
*   **API Documentation Focus:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around detailed API documentation, particularly for Asset management, highlighting both V1 and V2 versions of these APIs within the `Freshservice` ecosystem.
*   **Event-Driven UI Architecture:** The `search_content_screen_event.dart` file demonstrates the use of a sealed class pattern for defining distinct UI events, common in modern reactive and event-driven architectures.
*   **Incremental Refinement:** Small, focused changes are observed, such as correcting a text string in a BDD step or making a constructor parameter required in an event model, pointing to iterative development and quality assurance.
