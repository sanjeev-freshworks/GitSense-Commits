Its purpose is to set up the test environment by configuring the Flutter tester's view size (emulating an iPhone 11), pumping the `FSModuleAppWidget` with the `/support` initial route, and allowing the UI to settle for robust testing.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`**
    *   Updated significantly on 11/12/2025 at 8:07:09 PM, following a previous log at 8:07:02 PM.
    *   This BDD step, `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage`, verifies successful navigation to the support homepage by asserting the presence of specific UI elements. The key change was a correction in a text assertion from `'Complete your action a'` to the more accurate `'Complete your action items'`, indicating a typo fix or a refinement in the expected UI text.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart`**
    *   Updated on 11/13/2025 at 7:06:48 PM, following a previous log at 7:06:42 PM.
    *   This file defines a sealed class `SearchContentScreenEvent` and its subclasses, representing various events within a search content screen. The significant change was in the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor, which was modified to explicitly require the `searchText` parameter (`const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated({required this.searchText});`), ensuring that the initial search text is always provided when the view is created.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **November 12, 2025, 7:23 PM:** Extensive documentation of Asset APIs was recorded.
