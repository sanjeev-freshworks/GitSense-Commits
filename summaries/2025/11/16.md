## 12:35:06 AM
The log details changes across the `Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, primarily impacting API documentation, BDD test steps, and a common UI search event model.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 11/12/2025, 7:23:30 PM
    *   This markdown file serves as extensive documentation for Asset APIs within Freshservice, detailing both V2 and V1 endpoints. It outlines operations such as fetching associated assets for tickets and changes, searching assets by various criteria, managing asset types, attaching/detaching assets, retrieving form fields (main and CI type), obtaining vendor/product information, and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update) operations for assets. Detailed request methods, paths, query parameters, and example JSON payloads (especially for `Create Asset V2` and `Edit Asset V2`) are provided, with the `Edit Asset V2` example being truncated in the log. The content of the file remained identical between these two closely timed log entries, suggesting a re-save or minor metadata update rather than a content change.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM
    *   This file defines a BDD step `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage` for Flutter UI testing. It configures the test environment by setting the tester's view to an iPhone 11 screen size and then pumps the `FSModuleAppWidget` with `"/support"` as the initial route, waiting for the widget to settle.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM and 11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM
    *   This BDD test step, `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage`, is responsible for asserting the successful navigation to the support homepage. It checks for the presence of specific UI images (`icNotifications`, `icFSLogo`) and several text elements including 'Hi, how can we help you?', 'Report issue', 'Request service', and 'Browse help articles'. A key update occurred between the two timestamps: the asserted text `'Complete your action a'` was corrected to `'Complete your action items'` at 8:07:09 PM, indicating a minor fix to a test assertion.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/13/2025, 7:06:42 PM and 11/13/2025, 7:06:48 PM
    *   This file defines a sealed class `SearchContentScreenEvent` and its subclasses, representing various events within a search content screen (e.g., view created, search text changed, load results, click item, navigation handled). The significant change, occurring at 7:06:48 PM, updated the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` constructor to make the `searchText` parameter `required`, ensuring that this event is always created with an associated search query.

**Patterns and recurring elements:**

*   **Future Timestamps:** All changes are recorded with timestamps in November 2025.
*   **Flutter/Dart Development:** The `.dart` file extensions, `flutter_test` imports, `WidgetTester`, and Flutter-specific widget names (`FSModuleAppWidget`) confirm active development within a Flutter framework.
*   **BDD Testing Focus:** A significant portion of the changes (two out of four distinct files) are related to Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) test steps, indicating a focus on automated UI testing and clear definition of user behaviors.
*   **API Documentation:** Comprehensive API documentation is maintained, explicitly differentiating between V1 and V2 API versions, suggesting an ongoing transition or parallel support for different API generations.
*   **Refinement and Correctness:** Minor adjustments were made in both test assertions (fixing a typo) and code structure (making a constructor parameter `required`), highlighting continuous efforts in code quality and precision.

This log primarily details updates across documentation, BDD test steps, and core UI event definitions within a Freshservice mobile Flutter project.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md`**
The content of this Markdown file remained consistent across two timestamps on November 12, 2025, at 7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM. It serves as comprehensive documentation for "Asset API's," detailing numerous V2 and V1 API endpoints. Each API is described with its HTTP method (GET, PUT, POST), path, query parameters, and examples of request and response bodies, often referencing mock JSON files for success scenarios.
Key API categories documented include:
*   **Associated Assets:** For tickets and changes (GET, PUT to attach/detach).
*   **Asset Listing and Searching:** Retrieving asset lists, searching by various criteria (user ID, asset type, search term, filter term).
*   **Asset Types:** Getting a list of available asset types.
*   **Asset Fields:** Fetching main fields and CI type-specific fields for assets.
*   **Vendor and Product Information:** Retrieving details about vendors and products associated with assets.
*   **Asset CRUD Operations (V2):** Detailed examples for creating and editing assets, including a rich payload structure covering general asset attributes (name, tag, impact, description, dates, workspace, usage type, location, department, agent, user, group) and specific `type_fields` (compute type, physical/virtual subtype, product, vendor, warranty, acquisition date, state, serial number, audit date, region, availability zone, cost, depreciation, salvage).
The documentation outlines paths like `api/_/tickets/{ticket_id}/associated_assets`, `api/_/assets/`, `api/_/asset_types`, `api/_/changes/{change_id}/assets`, and `api/_/assets/{asset_display_id}`.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`**
On November 12, 2025, at 7:59:04 PM, this file was updated to define a BDD step `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`. This step is responsible for setting up a Flutter widget test environment by configuring the tester's view size to simulate an iPhone 11 and then pumping the `FSModuleAppWidget` with an `initialRoute` of "/support", effectively navigating to the support home page within the test.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`**
This file saw two updates on November 12, 2025.
*   At 8:07:02 PM, it defined a BDD step `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage`. This step includes assertions to verify the presence of specific UI elements on the support homepage, such as images (`icNotifications`, `icFSLogo`) and various text labels ('Hi, how can we help you?', 'Report issue', 'Request service', 'Complete your action a', 'Browse help articles').
*   A subsequent update at 8:07:09 PM involved a minor correction to one of the text assertions, changing 'Complete your action a' to 'Complete your action items', indicating a refinement in the expected UI text.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart`**
This file, defining event classes for a search content screen, also underwent two changes on November 13, 2025.
*   At 7:06:42 PM, it defined a `sealed class SearchContentScreenEvent` and several specific event types: `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated`, `SearchContentScreenEventSearchTextChanged`, `SearchContentScreenEventResetPagingState`, `SearchContentScreenEventLoadSearchResults`, `SearchContentScreenEventClickSearchItem`, and `SearchContentScreenEventNavigationHandled`. Notably, the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` initially had a `searchText` field but its constructor was empty.
*   A quick follow-up change at 7:06:48 PM updated the constructor for `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` to explicitly mark its `searchText` parameter as `required`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **API Documentation Structure:** The `asset.md` file consistently follows a detailed Markdown structure for documenting APIs, differentiating between V1 and V2 versions, and providing clear method, path, and request/response examples.
