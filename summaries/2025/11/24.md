# Activity Summary for 11/24/2025

## 9:15:10 AM
The changes primarily cover documentation updates, Flutter BDD test step refinements, Android manifest permission management, and minor adjustments to Flutter UI event models and widgets.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:23:30 PM (completing an entry started at 7:23:11 PM).
    *   **Update:** The documentation for Asset APIs (V1 and V2) was finalized. This involved detailing various API endpoints such as `Associated Assets`, `Get And Search Assets List`, `Asset Types`, `Attach/Detach Asset`, `Get Main/CI Type Fields`, `Get Vendor/Product Info`, `Create/Edit Asset V2`, and `Get Products/Search Products`. The later timestamp provided the complete JSON payload example for `Edit Asset V2`, which was truncated in the earlier entry.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM.
    *   **Update:** A Flutter BDD test step was added or modified. This step, `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`, sets the tester's view to an iPhone 11 size, pumps the `FSModuleAppWidget` with `/support` as the initial route, and waits for the UI to settle for 10 seconds.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM (correcting an entry from 8:07:02 PM).
    *   **Update:** A minor textual correction was made within a BDD test step. The assertion `iSeeText(tester, 'Complete your action a');` was updated to `iSeeText(tester, 'Complete your action items');`, correcting a typo.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/13/2025, 7:06:48 PM (modifying an entry from 7:06:42 PM).
    *   **Update:** The `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` class, part of the search content screen's event model, was updated. Its constructor now requires a `searchText` parameter: `const SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated({required this.searchText});`. Previously, it was parameterless.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
    *   **Significant Timestamps:** 11/17/2025, 6:18:00 PM, 6:20:09 PM, and 6:20:24 PM.
    *   **Update:** This Android Manifest file underwent several iterative changes related to permissions:
        *   Initially (6:16:41 PM), it included `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions.
        *   At 6:18:00 PM, comments were added to explain the purpose of `RECORD_AUDIO` and `INTERNET` for speech-to-text functionality.
        *   These comments were temporarily removed (6:18:28 PM) and then re-added, along with an accidental duplication of the `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions (6:20:09 PM).
        *   Finally, the duplicated permissions were removed, settling on a version with single permission declarations and descriptive comments for `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` (6:20:24 PM). The `queries` section consistently includes intents for `ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT` and `RecognitionService`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/17/2025, 7:21:56 PM to 7:26:12 PM.
    *   **Update:** While multiple log entries exist for this file within a short timeframe, the content remained identical across these entries. It consistently declares `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions, along with standard Flutter activity configurations and queries for text processing and speech recognition services.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/asset/requester_profile/view/components/requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/18/2025, 1:38:53 PM (modifying an entry from 1:38:41 PM).
    *   **Update:** In the `_RequesterAssetsListScreenRootState` widget, the `RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated()` call within the `initState` method was uncommented, activating the dispatch of this event upon widget initialization.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Flutter Development Focus:** A significant portion of the changes points towards active development in a Flutter application, including UI components, state management (events), and testing (BDD steps).
*   **Android Manifest Management:** Frequent, minor adjustments to Android Manifest files, particularly concerning `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, and Bluetooth-related permissions, suggest ongoing configuration or troubleshooting for native features like speech-to-text.
*   **Documentation Maintenance:** Dedicated updates to Markdown documentation for API endpoints indicate a focus on clear API usage and structure.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Several changes, particularly in the BDD steps and Android Manifest, show a pattern of small, iterative refinements and corrections.
*   **Consistent Feature Areas:** Changes often revolve around "Asset" management (documentation and UI) and "Support Portal" functionalities (BDD tests, asset lists), indicating these are active areas of development.
