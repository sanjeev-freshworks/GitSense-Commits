# Activity Summary for 11/25/2025

## 1:54:49 AM
The `freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` file received two updates on November 12, 2025, at 7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM. This file serves as a comprehensive documentation for Asset APIs, categorizing them into V2 and V1. It details numerous endpoints including those for associated assets (with tickets and changes), listing and searching assets by various parameters, retrieving asset types, attaching and detaching assets, fetching main and CI type fields, getting asset association lists, vendor details, product vendor information, and creating/editing assets. Each documented endpoint specifies the HTTP method, path, query parameters or payload examples, and links to mock JSON responses. The V2 `Create Asset` and `Edit Asset` payloads are particularly detailed, outlining a wide range of fields for asset creation and modification. The two timestamps show effectively the same content, suggesting a minor re-save or insignificant change in the `Edit Asset V2` section where the provided content is truncated.

The `apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` file was updated on November 12, 2025, at 7:59:04 PM. This Flutter BDD test step (`iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`) configures the test environment by setting the tester's view to an iPhone 11 size and device pixel ratio, then pumps the `FSModuleAppWidget` with an initial route of `/support`.

The `apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` file was updated twice on November 12, 2025, at 8:07:02 PM and 8:07:09 PM. The second update corrected a typo within a BDD assertion: `Complete your action a` was changed to `Complete your action items`, ensuring the test accurately verifies navigation to the support homepage by checking for specific UI images and corrected text elements.

The `libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/search/presentation/model/search_content_screen_event.dart` file saw two changes on November 13, 2025, at 7:06:42 PM and 7:06:48 PM. The update modified the `SearchContentScreenEventViewCreated` class, making the `searchText` field a required parameter in its constructor, which was previously omitted despite the field's presence. This change enforces proper initialization of search text when the view is created.

The Android Manifest file for the `fsmodule` app, located at `apps/fsmodule/.android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, underwent several modifications on November 17, 2025.
*   At 6:16:41 PM, the manifest listed standard permissions for `INTERNET`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`, along with `<queries>` for text processing and speech recognition services.
*   At 6:18:00 PM, explanatory comments were added for the permissions, explicitly linking them to a "speech-to-text feature."
*   This comment addition was then reverted at 6:18:28 PM and 6:18:43 PM, returning the file to its state without the detailed permission comments.
*   A subsequent change at 6:20:09 PM reintroduced the comments, but also inadvertently duplicated the `RECORD_AUDIO`, `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permission entries.
*   Finally, at 6:20:24 PM, the duplicate permission entries were removed, consolidating the permissions back to a single declaration while retaining the explanatory comments.

Similarly, the Android Manifest file for `fs_ui_catalog_app` at `apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` was logged three times on November 17, 2025, at 7:21:56 PM, 7:25:54 PM, and 7:26:12 PM. These entries show a consistent set of `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions and queries for text processing and speech recognition, with no functional changes across these timestamps.

The `features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/asset/requester_profile/view/components/requester_assets_list_screen_root.dart` file was updated on November 18, 2025, at 1:38:41 PM and 1:38:53 PM. The key change was uncommenting the line `widget.eventHandler(const RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated());` within the `initState` method. This change ensures that the `RequesterAssetsListEventViewCreated` event is now triggered upon the widget's initialization, likely initiating the loading of asset data for the requester's profile.

Across these changes, a recurring pattern is evident in the active development and refinement of the Freshservice mobile application. This includes detailed API documentation for asset management, ongoing work on BDD test cases (including minor fixes), and iterative adjustments to Android permissions, particularly those related to speech-to-text functionality. Furthermore, there are updates to Flutter state management and event handling, indicating continuous improvement in the application's UI and data flow. All recorded changes occurred within November 2025, highlighting a concentrated period of development activity.
