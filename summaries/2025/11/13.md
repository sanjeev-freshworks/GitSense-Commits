# Activity Summary for 11/13/2025

## 12:45:30 AM
The changes primarily involve documentation for Asset APIs and updates to BDD test steps within a Freshservice mobile Flutter project.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md`**
    *   **Timestamp of change:** 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 11/12/2025, 7:23:30 PM. The content across these two entries is nearly identical, with the latter being a truncated version of the former, indicating a single logical update to this documentation around this time.
    *   **Updates:** This Markdown file provides comprehensive documentation for various Asset APIs, categorized into V2 and V1. It outlines endpoints, methods (GET, PUT, POST), query parameters, payloads, and expected responses for a wide range of asset management operations. These operations include:
        *   Associated Assets (for tickets and changes).
        *   Searching and retrieving asset lists.
        *   Managing Asset Types.
        *   Attaching and detaching assets.
        *   Retrieving Main Fields and CI Type Fields (both V2).
        *   Fetching Asset Association Lists, Vendor Details, and Product Vendor Info.
        *   Creating and Editing Assets (V2).
        *   Older V1 APIs for asset listing, detail, form, CI type fields, creation, and updates are also documented.
        *   Detailed example JSON bodies are provided for Create and Edit Asset V2 calls.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp of change:** 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM.
    *   **Updates:** A BDD step function `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage` was defined or updated. This step simulates navigating to the `/support` route of the `FSModuleAppWidget` in a Flutter test environment, specifically configuring the tester view to mimic an iPhone 11's physical size and device pixel ratio. It includes a `pumpAndSettle` call to ensure widgets are rendered.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp of initial change:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM.
    *   **Timestamp of subsequent change:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM.
    *   **Updates:** This BDD step function `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage` was updated to verify UI elements after navigating to the support homepage. The significant change between the two timestamps is a **text assertion correction**: the expected text `'Complete your action a'` was updated to `'Complete your action items'`, indicating a fix for a typo or an update to the actual UI text. Other assertions check for the presence of `icNotifications`, `icFSLogo` images, and various text labels such as 'Hi, how can we help you?', 'Report issue', 'Request service', and 'Browse help articles'.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   **BDD Testing Focus:** There's a clear emphasis on BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) for the `fsmodule` application, particularly concerning the 'support' functionality, with specific steps defined for navigation and UI verification.
*   **Freshservice Mobile Context:** All changes relate to the `Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, indicating ongoing development and testing for a mobile application.
*   **API Versioning:** The `asset.md` documentation highlights the distinction between V1 and V2 APIs, suggesting a migration process or the coexistence of different API versions within the system.
*   **Documentation and Testing:** The log shows activity in both API documentation (Asset APIs) and automated testing (BDD steps), indicating a focus on both clarity of interface and quality assurance.
*   **Typo Correction in Tests:** The small, rapid change in `i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` for a text assertion indicates fine-tuning of test expectations.
