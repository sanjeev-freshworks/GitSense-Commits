# Activity Summary for 11/13/2025

## 12:45:30 AM
The changes primarily involve documentation for Asset APIs and updates to BDD test steps within a Freshservice mobile Flutter project.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md`**
    *   **Timestamp of change:** 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 11/12/2025, 7:23:30 PM. The content across these two entries is nearly identical, with the latter being a truncated version of the former, indicating a single logical update to this documentation around this time.
    *   **Updates:** This Markdown file provides comprehensive documentation for various Asset APIs, categorized into V2 and V1. It outlines endpoints, methods (GET, PUT, POST), query parameters, payloads, and expected responses for a wide range of asset management operations. These operations include:
        *   Associated Assets (for tickets and changes).
        *   Searching and retrieving asset lists.
        *   Managing Asset Types.
        *   Attaching and detaching assets.
        *   Retrieving Main Fields and CI Type Fields (both V2).
        *   Fetching Asset Association Lists, Vendor Details, and Product Vendor Info.
        *   Creating and Editing Assets (V2).
        *   Older V1 APIs for asset listing, detail, form, CI type fields, creation, and updates are also documented.
        *   Detailed example JSON bodies are provided for Create and Edit Asset V2 calls.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp of change:** 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM.
    *   **Updates:** A BDD step function `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage` was defined or updated. This step simulates navigating to the `/support` route of the `FSModuleAppWidget` in a Flutter test environment, specifically configuring the tester view to mimic an iPhone 11's physical size and device pixel ratio. It includes a `pumpAndSettle` call to ensure widgets are rendered.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp of initial change:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM.
    *   **Timestamp of subsequent change:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM.
    *   **Updates:** This BDD step function `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage` was updated to verify UI elements after navigating to the support homepage. The significant change between the two timestamps is a **text assertion correction**: the expected text `'Complete your action a'` was updated to `'Complete your action items'`, indicating a fix for a typo or an update to the actual UI text. Other assertions check for the presence of `icNotifications`, `icFSLogo` images, and various text labels such as 'Hi, how can we help you?', 'Report issue', 'Request service', and 'Browse help articles'.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   **BDD Testing Focus:** There's a clear emphasis on BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) for the `fsmodule` application, particularly concerning the 'support' functionality, with specific steps defined for navigation and UI verification.
*   **Freshservice Mobile Context:** All changes relate to the `Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, indicating ongoing development and testing for a mobile application.
*   **API Versioning:** The `asset.md` documentation highlights the distinction between V1 and V2 APIs, suggesting a migration process or the coexistence of different API versions within the system.
*   **Documentation and Testing:** The log shows activity in both API documentation (Asset APIs) and automated testing (BDD steps), indicating a focus on both clarity of interface and quality assurance.
*   **Typo Correction in Tests:** The small, rapid change in `i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` for a text assertion indicates fine-tuning of test expectations.

## 2:39:22 AM
A `markdown` documentation file located at `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md` was updated across two closely timed entries (11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM and 11/12/2025, 7:23:30 PM). This file details a comprehensive list of Asset API endpoints for Freshservice, categorized into V2 and V1 APIs. The documentation includes methods (GET, PUT, POST), paths, query parameters, and example request payloads for various operations such as:
    *   Managing associated assets for tickets and changes.
    *   Getting and searching asset lists, including filtering by asset type.
    *   Attaching and detaching assets.
    *   Retrieving asset type fields (main and CI type fields).
    *   Fetching vendor and product vendor information.
    *   Creating and editing assets (V2).
    *   And several V1 API equivalents for asset types, lists, details, forms, creation, updates, and last audit dates.
    The update between the two timestamps primarily involved completing a truncated code block for the `Edit Asset V2` payload example.

Two Flutter BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) test step files were also updated:

1.  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart` (11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM)
    This file defines the `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage` step. It configures the test environment by setting the device size to an iPhone 11, pumping the `FSModuleAppWidget` with an `initialRoute` of `/support`, and waiting for the UI to settle.

2.  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` (11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM and 11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM)
    This file defines the `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage` step, which verifies successful navigation to the support homepage. It asserts the presence of specific UI elements, including image assets like `icNotifications` and `icFSLogo`, and text elements such as 'Hi, how can we help you?', 'Report issue', 'Request service', and 'Browse help articles'. A minor correction occurred between the two timestamps, changing the asserted text from `'Complete your action a'` to `'Complete your action items'`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **API Documentation Structure:** The asset API documentation consistently uses Markdown tables to describe requests, responses (linking to JSON bodies), and notes. It prominently features unique numerical IDs (e.g., `2700xxxxxx`) for assets, asset types, users, etc., suggesting a standardized internal ID system.
*   **V1 and V2 APIs:** There's a clear distinction and separate documentation for V1 and V2 versions of many asset-related APIs, indicating a potential API evolution or migration in progress within the Freshservice platform.
*   **BDD Test Steps:** The Flutter changes are part of a BDD testing framework, with steps defined as `Future<void> functionName(WidgetTester tester)`. These steps utilize common helper functions like `iSeeFsImage` and `iSeeText` for UI assertions.
*   **Timestamp Proximity:** The rapid succession of updates within the `asset.md` file (19 seconds apart) and the `i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` file (7 seconds apart) suggests immediate follow-up commits for corrections or minor refinements after initial changes.

## 3:58:11 AM
The provided log details changes across two distinct files within the Freshservice mobile Flutter project.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/asset/asset.md`**

*   **Timestamp of significant change:** 11/12/2025, 7:23:11 PM (followed by a re-save at 7:23:30 PM with no content alteration in the provided snippets).
*   **Update:** This file is a comprehensive markdown documentation for Asset APIs, categorizing them into V1 and V2. It outlines numerous API endpoints, including `Associated Assets`, `Get And Search Assets List`, `Asset Types`, `Attach/Detach Asset (to ticket or change)`, `Get Main/CI Type Fields`, `Get Asset Association List`, `Vendor/Product Info`, `Get Asset List/Detail (V1 & V2)`, `Create Asset V2`, and `Edit Asset V2`.
*   **Content details:** Each documented endpoint specifies the HTTP method (GET, PUT, POST), API path, relevant query parameters, and example request payloads (especially detailed for `Create Asset V2` and `Edit Asset V2` which includes extensive fields like `name`, `asset_tag`, `asset_type_id`, `impact`, `description`, various dates, IDs for location, department, agent, user, group, and `type_fields` for compute type, product, vendor, warranty, asset state, serial number, cost, depreciation, etc.). The expected responses often link to specific JSON files within a `response/assets/` directory.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart`**

*   **Timestamp of significant change:** 11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM.
*   **Update:** This Flutter BDD step definition defines `iAmOnTheSupportHomePage`. It initializes the test environment by setting the device size to that of an iPhone 11, then pumps the `FSModuleAppWidget` with an `initialRoute` of "/support", effectively navigating to the support homepage for testing purposes.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart`**

*   **Timestamp of significant change:** 11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM (a minor correction occurred shortly after an initial update at 8:07:02 PM).
*   **Update:** This Flutter BDD step definition, `iShouldBeNavigatedToSupportHomepage`, contains assertions to verify that the user is indeed on the support homepage. It checks for the presence of specific UI images (`icNotifications`, `icFSLogo`) and several text elements ('Hi, how can we help you?', 'Report issue', 'Request service', 'Browse help articles').
*   **Specific change (between 8:07:02 PM and 8:07:09 PM):** A text assertion was corrected from `'Complete your action a'` to `'Complete your action items'`, indicating a refinement in the expected UI text.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **API Structure:** The `asset.md` documentation consistently uses `api/_/` for V2 API paths and older paths like `cmdb/items/` or `mobile/cmdb/items/` for V1. Most V2 APIs involve GET requests for lists and details, and PUT/POST for association/creation/editing.
*   **BDD Testing:** The Flutter changes indicate an active development/testing phase using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with `bdd_widget_test`. The BDD step definitions follow a pattern of `Future<void> functionName(WidgetTester tester) async { ... }` and rely on common helper functions like `iSeeFsImage` and `iSeeText` for UI element verification.
*   **Response Documentation:** The `asset.md` file frequently links to external JSON files for example API responses, centralizing the response data.
*   **Timestamp Proximity:** There are very close timestamps for changes within the same file (e.g., `asset.md` at 7:23:11 PM and 7:23:30 PM, and `i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart` at 8:07:02 PM and 8:07:09 PM), suggesting rapid iteration, re-saves, or minor immediate corrections.

    *   This markdown file documents Asset APIs for Freshservice, outlining both V2 and some referenced V1 endpoints. The content is identical across both timestamps, suggesting either a re-save without changes or a very minor, uncaptured change.
    *   **V2 APIs documented include:**
        *   Associated Assets (GET for tickets and changes).
        *   Asset listing and searching (`GET api/_/assets/` with various query parameters like `per_page`, `asset_type_id`, `search`, `filter`).
        *   Retrieving Asset Types (`GET api/_/asset_types`).
        *   Searching assets to associate (`GET api/_/assets-to-associate` by entity, entity_id, user_id).
        *   Attaching and Detaching Assets (`PUT` for tickets and changes with `item_ids` or `cmdb_req_id`).
        *   Retrieving main fields and CI type fields (`GET` for `asset_type_fields/edit_default_fields` and `asset_types/{asset_type_id}/fields`).
        *   Getting Asset Association List (`GET api/_/assets/{asset_id}/requests`).
        *   Vendor and Product Vendor information (`GET api/_/products/{product_id}` and `api/_/product_vendors`).
        *   Creating and Editing Assets (`POST api/_/assets` and `PUT api/_/assets/{asset_display_id}`) with comprehensive JSON payloads demonstrating various asset fields, type-specific fields (e.g., `compute_type`, `physical_subtype`, `warranty`, `acquisition_date`, `serial_number`, `asset_state`), and financial details (cost, depreciation, salvage).
    *   **V1 APIs referenced include:** Getting Asset List, Asset Detail, Asset Form, CI Type Fields, Create Asset, Update Asset, and Update Last Audit Date.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_am_on_the_support_home_page.dart**
    *   **Timestamp:** `11/12/2025, 7:59:04 PM`
    *   This Flutter BDD step defines the action "I am on the support home page". It configures the test environment by setting the tester's view to an iPhone 11 size and device pixel ratio. It then pumps the `FSModuleAppWidget` with the `"/support"` initial route and waits for the UI to settle, effectively navigating to and rendering the support homepage for testing purposes.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/common/i_should_be_navigated_to_support_homepage.dart**
    *   **Timestamps:** `11/12/2025, 8:07:02 PM` and `11/12/2025, 8:07:09 PM`
    *   This Flutter BDD step defines the assertion "I should be navigated to support homepage". It verifies navigation by checking for the presence of specific UI elements, namely the `icNotifications` and `icFSLogo` images, and several key text strings: 'Hi, how can we help you?', 'Report issue', 'Request service', 'Complete your action items', and 'Browse help articles'.
    *   A minor textual correction occurred between the two timestamps: "Complete your action a" was updated to "Complete your action items", indicating a refinement in the expected text for a UI element within the test.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **API Documentation Structure:** The `asset.md` file consistently uses a structured format for documenting API endpoints, including Method, Path, QueryParams/Payload, and a table mapping Request parameters to Response JSON bodies and notes (usually "Success"). This demonstrates a systematic approach to API mock documentation.
*   **BDD Testing Approach:** The Flutter `.dart` files represent a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing pattern for the Freshservice mobile app. They define clear, human-readable steps like "I am on the support home page" (an action) and "I should be navigated to support homepage" (an assertion), utilizing helper functions (`iSeeFsImage`, `iSeeText`) to interact with and verify the UI.
*   **Focus on Asset Management and Support Portal:** The changes collectively highlight development efforts around asset management APIs (V1 and V2) and the user-facing support portal functionality within the Freshservice mobile application.
*   **Timestamp Proximity:** All changes occurred within a short timeframe on the same date, suggesting a focused work session or a series of related commits.
