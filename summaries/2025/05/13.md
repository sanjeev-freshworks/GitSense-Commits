# Activity Summary for 5/13/2025

## 8:39:50 AM
The log shows two entries for the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/copilot-instructions.md`, both at approximately 8:38 AM on May 13, 2025.  The entries are identical.  The file content is a detailed guide for using GitHub Copilot within the Freshservice Flutter mobile application project.

The guide outlines the project's architecture (Clean Architecture with BLoC pattern), technologies used (Flutter, Dart, various packages like Melos, get_it, flutter_bloc, go_router), and a comprehensive directory structure.  The project is organized into `apps`, `features`, and `libraries` directories, promoting modularity and reusability.  Each feature/library adheres to a consistent structure encompassing data, domain, and UI layers.  The document also specifies coding best practices, naming conventions, and testing guidelines.  The goals for Copilot are clearly defined: generating code that respects Clean Architecture, separating concerns, scaffolding new features consistently, encouraging testing, and maintaining code quality.  No actual code changes are present; the log only reflects the creation or update of this instruction document itself.


## 9:39:51 AM
The log shows a series of code changes related to Freshservice mobile application development on  May 13th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on documenting guidelines for code structure and API-to-data model mapping.

The first change (9:22:37 AM) details visual guidelines for the project's structure.  It uses Mermaid markdown to illustrate a monorepo layout, showing how `apps`, `features`, `libraries`, and other directories relate.  A corresponding SVG representation is also included, although it's omitted from the summary for brevity, as the Mermaid version is preferred. A second diagram shows a recommended package structure using Mermaid and SVG, illustrating the internal layout of feature/library modules, emphasizing clean architecture principles (data, domain, UI layers). A third diagram outlines the flow of a clean architecture, again using Mermaid.


The second change (9:26:37 AM) provides detailed guidelines for creating Dart mappers that transform API models to data models.  It specifies directory structure (`data/datasource/remote/mapper/`), file naming conventions (snake_case + `_api_model_mapper.dart`), and rules for handling nullable fields based on API specifications (mandatory, default, optional).  Examples are provided showing `toDataModel()` extension methods handling nested models and lists gracefully, avoiding exceptions.


The third change (9:29:24 AM) visually represents the API-to-data model mapper guidelines using Mermaid diagrams.  It shows the directory and file structure, the extension structure for mapping, the logic for handling nullability and fields, and a concrete example of mapping `TicketApiModel` to `Ticket`.  This reinforces the guidelines established in the previous code change using visual aids.

In summary, the changes reflect a concerted effort to establish clear and consistent coding standards, particularly regarding project structure and data handling, using visual aids for improved clarity and maintainability.  The use of Mermaid diagrams suggests a preference for documentation that is easily integrated into code repositories like GitHub.
