# Activity Summary for 5/13/2025

## 8:39:50 AM
The log shows two entries for the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/copilot-instructions.md`, both at approximately 8:38 AM on May 13, 2025.  The entries are identical.  The file content is a detailed guide for using GitHub Copilot within the Freshservice Flutter mobile application project.

The guide outlines the project's architecture (Clean Architecture with BLoC pattern), technologies used (Flutter, Dart, various packages like Melos, get_it, flutter_bloc, go_router), and a comprehensive directory structure.  The project is organized into `apps`, `features`, and `libraries` directories, promoting modularity and reusability.  Each feature/library adheres to a consistent structure encompassing data, domain, and UI layers.  The document also specifies coding best practices, naming conventions, and testing guidelines.  The goals for Copilot are clearly defined: generating code that respects Clean Architecture, separating concerns, scaffolding new features consistently, encouraging testing, and maintaining code quality.  No actual code changes are present; the log only reflects the creation or update of this instruction document itself.
