The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/components/image/fs_image.dart` between 7:06 PM and 7:09 PM on May 11, 2025.  No changes were observed in the code itself during this period; only the timestamp changed. This suggests repeated saves or commits without code modifications.

Later, at 7:17:26 PM on May 11, 2025, a significant change occurred in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/core_ui.dart`. This file acts as an export file for various components, models, utilities, and theme elements within the `core_ui` library. The update likely involved adding or updating exports for various components (buttons, cards, dialogs, etc.), models, utils, and theme related files.

A series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/create_component.md`  occurred between 7:21 PM and 7:29 PM. These edits seem to reflect an iterative process of refining a prompt or documentation for creating new Flutter components.  The final version of the prompt focuses on generating a profile image component.

Finally, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_sdk/lib/src/ui/route/fs_sdk_route_builder.dart` was modified between 7:31 PM and 7:43 PM.  This involved adding a new route and component for a profile image (`/support/profile_image`) to the application's navigation structure. The  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_sdk/lib/src/ui/profile_image/profile_image_component.dart` file was created at 7:45:22 PM, containing the implementation for the profile image component.  This component allows users to select an image from their photo library or take a picture using the camera.
