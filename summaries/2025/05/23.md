# Activity Summary for 5/23/2025

## 6:02:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two Dart files within a Flutter project, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/components_catalog_screen.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/approvals_screen.dart`,  and a markdown file containing UI generation steps.

The `components_catalog_screen.dart` file underwent three revisions between 6:11:38 PM and 6:11:55 PM on May 22, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor and did not change the code's functionality; the code remained identical across all three commits. The file displays a catalog of UI components (search, buttons, toggle, checkbox, radio buttons, chips, and tags) using a custom UI library (`core_ui`).

The `approvals_screen.dart` file saw substantial changes between 6:22:17 PM and 6:33:38 PM on May 22, 2025.  The initial versions used custom `OutlinedButton` and `ElevatedButton` widgets.  Later revisions (starting around 6:24:24 PM) replaced these with components from the `core_ui` library: `FSSecondaryButton` and `FSPrimaryButton`, respectively.  Additionally, there were several minor changes made throughout the code, primarily involving adjustments to color schemes and text themes, using properties like `context.theme.fsColorScheme` for consistent styling.  The `_buildPriorityTag` function also received a significant update at 6:33:06 PM, replacing a manual switch statement with the use of `FSTag` variants from the `core_ui` library for more concise and maintainable priority tag rendering. The final version consistently uses the `core_ui` components, improving code organization and reusability.


The markdown file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/temp_prompts/ui_gen.prompt.md`  was revised multiple times (between 6:14:15 PM and 6:20:04 PM) on May 22, 2025. This file outlines a nine-step process for generating a UI from Figma designs. The main changes refine step 8, clarifying the use of  `core_ui` components and colors mapped in previous steps for implementing the screen in the `fs_ui_catalog_app` module.  There's also a note added in later revisions emphasizing the importance of preserving all information. The overall process involves fetching Figma data, mapping UI elements and colors to a `core_ui` library, implementing the screen, and showcasing it.


## 8:36:09 AM
The log shows multiple edits to two Dart files (`search_component_catalog_screen.dart` and `approval_screen_component.dart`) within the Freshservice mobile Flutter application.  There's also a log of changes to a markdown file (`ui_temp.prompt.md`) detailing a process for mapping Figma UI components and colors to a `core_ui` module, followed by implementation and showcasing in the `fs_ui_catalog_app` module.  Several JSON files are referenced (`button_figma.json`, `checkbox_figma.json`, etc.), presumably containing Figma design data.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/search_component_catalog_screen.dart` underwent several modifications between 7:39:17 AM and 7:39:42 AM on 5/23/2025. The code remained identical across these edits, suggesting potential accidental multiple saves or version control issues. At 7:40:57 AM, the file was seemingly emptied.  This file implements a search screen, utilizing `FSSearchField` and `FSListTile` from the `core_ui` package.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/approval_screen_component.dart` was modified multiple times between 7:44:05 AM and 7:49:04 AM on 5/23/2025.  The changes involved refactoring the UI.  Initially, standard Flutter widgets (`OutlinedButton`, `ElevatedButton`) were used.  These were subsequently replaced with custom components from the `core_ui` library (`FSOutlineButton`, `FSPrimaryButton`, `FSTag`). The `_buildPriorityTag` function was significantly altered, moving from a custom color-assignment approach to using the `FSTag` component for better maintainability and consistency.  The background color of the `Scaffold` was changed from `context.theme.fsColorScheme.fill.background` to `context.theme.fsColorScheme.fill.surface`, and the `BottomNavigationBar`'s unselectedItemColor was changed from `context.theme.fsColorScheme.text.tertiary` to `context.theme.fsColorScheme.text.secondary`. This file implements an approval screen with a delegation banner, approval cards, and a bottom navigation bar.  The edits showcase a move toward consistent use of the `core_ui` components and a simplification of the code.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/temp_prompts/ui_temp.prompt.md` was modified multiple times between 8:21:27 AM and 8:30:06 AM on 5/23/2025. These edits progressively refined a markdown document outlining a workflow for UI component and color mapping from Figma JSON data to the `core_ui` module. The instructions are detailed, involving steps for identifying components, creating mapping documents, and implementing the UI in the `fs_ui_catalog_app` using the `core_ui` components. The number of Figma files to be processed increased over time.  The final version focuses on detailed mapping and implementation with emphasis on including all component properties.

The overall pattern across the log entries indicates a systematic effort to integrate and standardize the UI of the Freshservice mobile app using a shared `core_ui` component library.  The repeated edits suggest an iterative process of refinement and improvement.
