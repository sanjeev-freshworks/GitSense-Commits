# Activity Summary for 5/23/2025

## 6:02:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two Dart files within a Flutter project, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/components_catalog_screen.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/approvals_screen.dart`,  and a markdown file containing UI generation steps.

The `components_catalog_screen.dart` file underwent three revisions between 6:11:38 PM and 6:11:55 PM on May 22, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor and did not change the code's functionality; the code remained identical across all three commits. The file displays a catalog of UI components (search, buttons, toggle, checkbox, radio buttons, chips, and tags) using a custom UI library (`core_ui`).

The `approvals_screen.dart` file saw substantial changes between 6:22:17 PM and 6:33:38 PM on May 22, 2025.  The initial versions used custom `OutlinedButton` and `ElevatedButton` widgets.  Later revisions (starting around 6:24:24 PM) replaced these with components from the `core_ui` library: `FSSecondaryButton` and `FSPrimaryButton`, respectively.  Additionally, there were several minor changes made throughout the code, primarily involving adjustments to color schemes and text themes, using properties like `context.theme.fsColorScheme` for consistent styling.  The `_buildPriorityTag` function also received a significant update at 6:33:06 PM, replacing a manual switch statement with the use of `FSTag` variants from the `core_ui` library for more concise and maintainable priority tag rendering. The final version consistently uses the `core_ui` components, improving code organization and reusability.


The markdown file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/temp_prompts/ui_gen.prompt.md`  was revised multiple times (between 6:14:15 PM and 6:20:04 PM) on May 22, 2025. This file outlines a nine-step process for generating a UI from Figma designs. The main changes refine step 8, clarifying the use of  `core_ui` components and colors mapped in previous steps for implementing the screen in the `fs_ui_catalog_app` module.  There's also a note added in later revisions emphasizing the importance of preserving all information. The overall process involves fetching Figma data, mapping UI elements and colors to a `core_ui` library, implementing the screen, and showcasing it.


## 8:36:09 AM
The log shows multiple edits to two Dart files (`search_component_catalog_screen.dart` and `approval_screen_component.dart`) within the Freshservice mobile Flutter application.  There's also a log of changes to a markdown file (`ui_temp.prompt.md`) detailing a process for mapping Figma UI components and colors to a `core_ui` module, followed by implementation and showcasing in the `fs_ui_catalog_app` module.  Several JSON files are referenced (`button_figma.json`, `checkbox_figma.json`, etc.), presumably containing Figma design data.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/search_component_catalog_screen.dart` underwent several modifications between 7:39:17 AM and 7:39:42 AM on 5/23/2025. The code remained identical across these edits, suggesting potential accidental multiple saves or version control issues. At 7:40:57 AM, the file was seemingly emptied.  This file implements a search screen, utilizing `FSSearchField` and `FSListTile` from the `core_ui` package.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/approval_screen_component.dart` was modified multiple times between 7:44:05 AM and 7:49:04 AM on 5/23/2025.  The changes involved refactoring the UI.  Initially, standard Flutter widgets (`OutlinedButton`, `ElevatedButton`) were used.  These were subsequently replaced with custom components from the `core_ui` library (`FSOutlineButton`, `FSPrimaryButton`, `FSTag`). The `_buildPriorityTag` function was significantly altered, moving from a custom color-assignment approach to using the `FSTag` component for better maintainability and consistency.  The background color of the `Scaffold` was changed from `context.theme.fsColorScheme.fill.background` to `context.theme.fsColorScheme.fill.surface`, and the `BottomNavigationBar`'s unselectedItemColor was changed from `context.theme.fsColorScheme.text.tertiary` to `context.theme.fsColorScheme.text.secondary`. This file implements an approval screen with a delegation banner, approval cards, and a bottom navigation bar.  The edits showcase a move toward consistent use of the `core_ui` components and a simplification of the code.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/temp_prompts/ui_temp.prompt.md` was modified multiple times between 8:21:27 AM and 8:30:06 AM on 5/23/2025. These edits progressively refined a markdown document outlining a workflow for UI component and color mapping from Figma JSON data to the `core_ui` module. The instructions are detailed, involving steps for identifying components, creating mapping documents, and implementing the UI in the `fs_ui_catalog_app` using the `core_ui` components. The number of Figma files to be processed increased over time.  The final version focuses on detailed mapping and implementation with emphasis on including all component properties.

The overall pattern across the log entries indicates a systematic effort to integrate and standardize the UI of the Freshservice mobile app using a shared `core_ui` component library.  The repeated edits suggest an iterative process of refinement and improvement.


## 9:11:39 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two `.arb` files: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb`.  The changes span a short timeframe on May 23, 2025, between approximately 9:04 AM and 9:09 AM.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` file underwent several revisions in rapid succession.  These revisions primarily involved adding new key-value pairs related to approval workflows.  The additions include translations for various approval statuses (Approved, Rejected, Requested, etc.), actions (Approve, Reject, Cancel), delegation features ("Delegate approvals", "Delegate to", etc.), and error messages.  There is a recurring pattern of using placeholders like `{count}`, `{date}`, `{approvedBy}`, and `{rejectedBy}` within the strings to support dynamic text updates. The final version includes  keys related to approval delegation ("viewApprovalDelegateTitle", "viewApprovalDelegateEditButton", etc.).

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` file received fewer but notable changes. The most significant update at 9:09:45 AM added the `commonUntil` key.  This file contains general UI strings, error messages (network errors, access denied), and file handling related messages.  It also contains time-related placeholders (`{count}`) for displaying timestamps.  Similar to the other file, it includes a "freddyTranslationCharacterLimitExceeded" key, suggesting integration with a translation service.


## 9:36:06 AM
The log shows a series of edits to a `ui_codegen_guidelines.instructions.md` file and several iterations of a prompt file (`ui_temp.prompt.md`) between 8:39 AM and 9:18 AM on May 23, 2025.  The `ui_temp.prompt.md` file undergoes numerous revisions, all focusing on the same core task: creating guidelines for mapping UI components and colors from Figma JSON data and Figma design links to corresponding components and colors within a `core_ui` and a `common_ui` module in a Flutter project.

The initial `ui_temp.prompt.md` file requests detailed descriptions of Figma JSON data for various UI elements (buttons, checkboxes, etc.), mapping these to components in the `core_ui` module, describing Figma color JSON, mapping those to the `core_ui` theme, and finally, creating comprehensive markdown guidelines for this mapping process.  Subsequent revisions modify this prompt by:

* **Expanding the scope of Step 2:** Initially mapping UI components only to `core_ui`, the prompt later includes the `common_ui` module as a target.
* **Refining the color mapping (Step 4):**  The prompt becomes more specific in referencing the color scheme and text theme properties within the `core_ui` module, even adding specific examples like `context.theme.fsTextTheme.regular.callout`.
* **Clarifying Step 5:** The instruction for creating markdown guidelines in Step 5 becomes more detailed and precise, emphasizing the need for clarity and detail suitable for use with GitHub Copilot.  Repeated edits focus on ensuring developers only use components from `core_ui` and `common_ui`, resorting to native Flutter widgets only when strictly necessary.

Finally, at 9:12 AM and 9:12:54 AM, `ui_codegen_guidelines.instructions.md` is updated, presumably reflecting the output generated from the refined prompt. This file contains detailed guidelines for mapping various UI components (buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, avatars, dialogs, snackbars, etc.) and colors from Figma to the `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules in the Flutter project.  Example code snippets are included for many components.

Between 9:14 AM and 9:18 AM, a new prompt file, `ui_codegen.prompt.md` (later `ui_codegen.md`), appears, directing the use of the `ui_codegen_guidelines.instructions.md` file to implement a specific Figma design (link provided) into a new Flutter screen in the `fs_ui_catalog_app` module. This final prompt reiterates the constraint of prioritizing the use of `core_ui` and `common_ui` components, only resorting to native Flutter widgets if absolutely necessary.  The intended output here is a new Flutter screen (`figma_screen.dart`) with its implementation showcased.


## 10:11:47 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two `.arb` files: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb`.  These files appear to contain internationalization (i18n) strings for an application.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` file underwent numerous revisions between 9:19:19 AM and 9:59:15 AM on May 23, 2025.  These changes primarily involved adding and refining strings related to approval workflows, including:

* **Approval statuses:**  Strings for "Approved," "Rejected," "Requested," "Cancelled," etc., were added.
* **Approval actions:**  Phrases describing approval and rejection actions, including timestamps and user information.
* **Delegation:**  Extensive additions to handle approval delegation, adding strings such as "Delegate approvals," "Delegated to," "Until," and error messages related to delegation.
* **Success/Failure messages:**  Strings confirming successful actions (e.g., "Approval cancelled successfully") and handling failures.
* **Pluralization:**  Use of pluralization for phrases like "{count} members" and "{approvalCount} approvals" to manage variable counts.

The changes seem iterative, with small additions and modifications to existing keys and values in each update.  A notable addition was the key "approvalsDelegated" which appears to be dynamically populated with user names and dates.  There was also a noticeable correction in the formatting of the `delegatedApproval` key at 9:54:11 AM and a similar issue with the `someoneDelegatedApprovalToSomeone` key at 9:55:36 AM.  Both keys were finalized in a corrected form in the next update.  The final update to this file, at 9:59:15 AM, appears to complete the refinements regarding approval delegation and other minor updates.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` file received fewer updates, between 9:22:20 AM and 10:09:31 AM on May 23, 2025. These changes focused on general UI elements such as:

* **Error handling:** Strings for network errors, access denied errors, and generic errors.
* **File handling:**  Messages for unsupported file types, file size limits, and cloud drive functionality.
* **Date and time formatting:**  The `commonDateTimePlaceholderFormat` key was modified to include time information, adding `HH: MM` to `DD-MM-YYYY`.
* **UI Actions:**  Added strings related to "manage" actions, "view more", "view less" functionality.
* **Translation handling:** Strings for translation features, including success and failure messages and character limits ("freddyTranslate," "freddyTranslationCharacterLimitExceeded").


In summary, the code changes reflect the development and refinement of an approval workflow feature and associated UI elements within a mobile application.  The frequent, incremental updates to the approval library's i18n file suggest iterative development and testing of this specific feature.  The `common_ui` file had fewer updates, suggesting its stability or that there were less significant changes in general UI elements.


## 12:13:50 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `fs_ui_catalog_app` Flutter application.  The updates involve creating and refining UI screens based on Figma designs, utilizing custom UI components from `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules.

The initial changes (around 11:17 AM) include setting up the main application file (`main.dart`) and importing necessary packages, notably `core_ui`, `common_ui`, and `form_lib`.

Between 11:18 AM and 11:24 AM, numerous edits to a prompt file (`ui_codegen.prompt.md`) refine the steps for code generation based on Figma designs.  The process involves mapping Figma components to existing UI components and avoiding the use of native Flutter widgets.  The target location for the new screen implementation is consistently `/lib/screens/figma_screen.dart` within the `fs_ui_catalog_app` module. The Figma design link, `https://www.figma.com/design/UmPsGEv6o3w6RXHONlecU2/FS-Mobile-Ninja?node-id=27632-10549&m=dev`, is repeatedly referenced.

A `figma_screen.dart` file is created and modified multiple times (between 11:24 AM and 11:34 AM) to implement a form based on the Figma design.  The implementation uses `core_ui` components like `FSTextField`, `FSPrimaryButton`, etc. There are several revisions, with changes to styling, spacing, and the use of theme extensions for consistent design.  The final version around 11:34 AM uses direct spacing constants (24 and 16) instead of theme extensions.  A second implementation appears briefly (around 11:27 AM) which is a `DelegationFormScreen` implemented from the Figma design.

Instructions for showcasing new UI components (`showcase_new_screen.md` - 11:19 AM) detail the process of integrating a new component into the UI catalog, including enum updates and catalog screen additions.

A `figma_screen_catalog_screen.dart` file is created at 11:35 AM, this component seemingly provides a way to showcase different states of the `figma_screen`.

Later changes (from 11:42 AM onwards) further revise `figma_screen.dart` leading to a new design that resembles a contact form. This includes the use of standard Flutter `TextFormField` with custom styling to maintain consistency with the `core_ui` components.


There is a recurring pattern of iterating on the design and implementation of the `figma_screen.dart` file and the `ui_codegen.prompt.md` file. The `FreshserviceComponentsElements` enum remains largely unchanged.  The overall pattern indicates an iterative design and development process, with multiple refinements to the UI and the instructions for its creation.


## 1:13:33 PM
The log shows a single update to the English language resource file (`intl_en.arb`) at 5/23/2025, 12:44:28 PM.  This file contains numerous localized strings for various UI elements and error messages within a Freshservice mobile application.  The update includes additions and modifications to existing strings related to error handling (network errors, access denied, generic errors), user prompts (discarding changes, confirmations), time display formatting (seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years ago), file handling (attachment selection, upload errors, file type restrictions, size limits), and general UI components (buttons, labels, placeholders).  There's also the addition of translations-related strings ("Translate", "Translating", etc.) suggesting the integration of a translation feature.  The strings use placeholders for dynamic content, such as file names and types, and file sizes.  A recurring pattern is the consistent inclusion of descriptive error messages and user-friendly prompts for various scenarios.


## 1:13:40 PM
The log shows multiple edits to several Dart files within a Flutter project, focusing on UI component development.  The primary files modified are  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/approval_delegate_form_screen.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/delegate_form_screen.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/screen_figma_catalog_screen.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/edit_delegation_screen.dart`.


`approval_delegate_form_screen.dart`: This file underwent several minor edits between 12:14 PM and 12:15 PM on May 23rd, 2025. The content remained largely unchanged; these edits likely involved minor formatting or whitespace adjustments.  A subsequent edit at 12:15:39 PM resulted in an empty file.

`delegate_form_screen.dart`: This file shows a significant code refactoring between 12:17 PM and 12:18 PM. The initial version used `TextEditingController` objects to manage text input, while the final version switched to managing text directly within the state using strings (`delegateTo`, `from`, `until`, `notes`).  This simplifies state management and removes the need for `dispose()` calls.  The file also changed its styling to adopt `AppBar` instead of `FSAppBar`, switching to standard EdgeInsets for padding.  The snackbar implementation changed from `FSSnackBar` to `ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar`.

`screen_figma_catalog_screen.dart`: This file, created around 1:02 PM, showcases various UI components from the `core_ui` library, demonstrating their usage in a list view. Multiple edits around this time suggest minor corrections or additions to this example screen.  The code includes components such as `FSSearchField`, `FSPrimaryButton`, `FSListTile`, `FSUserAvatar`, `FSTag`, `FSInlineMessage`, and `FSCircularProgressIndicator`, all indicating a consistent theme and style.


`edit_delegation_screen.dart`: This file was created at 1:05 PM.  The code snippet indicates the initial implementation of a screen for editing delegation, using components from the `core_ui` library.

The `.github/prompts` directory contains files related to generating UI code using prompts. The `ui_temp.prompt.md` file details a multi-step process for mapping Figma design data to a Flutter UI codebase utilizing the `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules.  There's a repeated and refined prompt within the `ui_codegen.prompt.md` file which describes the detailed steps for generating code from Figma JSON data. These revisions refine the instructions for the code generation process.  The overall pattern suggests an iterative workflow for building UI elements based on Figma designs and pre-built UI components.
