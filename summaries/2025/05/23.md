# Activity Summary for 5/23/2025

## 6:02:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two Dart files within a Flutter project, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/components_catalog_screen.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/approvals_screen.dart`,  and a markdown file containing UI generation steps.

The `components_catalog_screen.dart` file underwent three revisions between 6:11:38 PM and 6:11:55 PM on May 22, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor and did not change the code's functionality; the code remained identical across all three commits. The file displays a catalog of UI components (search, buttons, toggle, checkbox, radio buttons, chips, and tags) using a custom UI library (`core_ui`).

The `approvals_screen.dart` file saw substantial changes between 6:22:17 PM and 6:33:38 PM on May 22, 2025.  The initial versions used custom `OutlinedButton` and `ElevatedButton` widgets.  Later revisions (starting around 6:24:24 PM) replaced these with components from the `core_ui` library: `FSSecondaryButton` and `FSPrimaryButton`, respectively.  Additionally, there were several minor changes made throughout the code, primarily involving adjustments to color schemes and text themes, using properties like `context.theme.fsColorScheme` for consistent styling.  The `_buildPriorityTag` function also received a significant update at 6:33:06 PM, replacing a manual switch statement with the use of `FSTag` variants from the `core_ui` library for more concise and maintainable priority tag rendering. The final version consistently uses the `core_ui` components, improving code organization and reusability.


The markdown file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/temp_prompts/ui_gen.prompt.md`  was revised multiple times (between 6:14:15 PM and 6:20:04 PM) on May 22, 2025. This file outlines a nine-step process for generating a UI from Figma designs. The main changes refine step 8, clarifying the use of  `core_ui` components and colors mapped in previous steps for implementing the screen in the `fs_ui_catalog_app` module.  There's also a note added in later revisions emphasizing the importance of preserving all information. The overall process involves fetching Figma data, mapping UI elements and colors to a `core_ui` library, implementing the screen, and showcasing it.
