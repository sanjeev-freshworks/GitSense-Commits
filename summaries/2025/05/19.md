# Activity Summary for 5/19/2025

## 1:13:02 PM
The log shows code changes across several files within a Flutter project, primarily focused on UI development and dependency injection.

On **May 19, 2025**,  at approximately 12:45 PM, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/di/approvals_lib_module.dart` file was updated. This file defines a dependency injection module (`ApprovalsLibModule`) for an approval library, separating data and UI layer dependencies.  The update likely introduced or refactored this module.


Between 12:49 PM and 1:06 PM, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/showcase_new_screen.prompt.md` file underwent numerous revisions. This markdown file appears to be a step-by-step guide for adding a new view component (`NewViewComponent`) to a UI catalog application (`fs_ui_catalog_app`). The revisions iteratively refine the instructions, ultimately detailing the steps of:

1. Adding a new enum value to `freshservice_components_elements` in `../../../apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/model/freshservice_components_elements.dart`.
2. Creating a new file (`new_view_component_catalog_screen.dart`) in the `components` directory  to display the new view component.
3. Updating the `freshservice_components_screen` file (`../../../apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/freshservice_components_screen.dart`) to include and navigate to the new screen.
4. Adding necessary exports to make the new component available.

At 12:56:46 PM, the `freshservice_components_elements` enum in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/model/freshservice_components_elements.dart` was updated,  likely to include the new `NewViewComponent`.

Finally, between 1:06 PM and 1:11 PM, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_color_mapping.prompt.md` file was updated multiple times. This file appears to be a prompt to implement a Figma design into the `approval_lib` module. The changes show revisions to the Figma design link  and  removal of context sections.

At 1:12 PM, the  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/ui/screens/copilot_approval_request/presentation/model/approval_request_ui_model.dart` file was updated twice with identical code. This file defines a data model (`ApprovalRequestUiModel`) likely for the UI implementation described in the `ui_color_mapping.prompt.md` file.  The update probably established or modified this data model using the Freezed package for immutability.
