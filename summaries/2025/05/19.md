# Activity Summary for 5/19/2025

## 1:13:02 PM
The log shows code changes across several files within a Flutter project, primarily focused on UI development and dependency injection.

On **May 19, 2025**,  at approximately 12:45 PM, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/di/approvals_lib_module.dart` file was updated. This file defines a dependency injection module (`ApprovalsLibModule`) for an approval library, separating data and UI layer dependencies.  The update likely introduced or refactored this module.


Between 12:49 PM and 1:06 PM, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/showcase_new_screen.prompt.md` file underwent numerous revisions. This markdown file appears to be a step-by-step guide for adding a new view component (`NewViewComponent`) to a UI catalog application (`fs_ui_catalog_app`). The revisions iteratively refine the instructions, ultimately detailing the steps of:

1. Adding a new enum value to `freshservice_components_elements` in `../../../apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/model/freshservice_components_elements.dart`.
2. Creating a new file (`new_view_component_catalog_screen.dart`) in the `components` directory  to display the new view component.
3. Updating the `freshservice_components_screen` file (`../../../apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/freshservice_components_screen.dart`) to include and navigate to the new screen.
4. Adding necessary exports to make the new component available.

At 12:56:46 PM, the `freshservice_components_elements` enum in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/model/freshservice_components_elements.dart` was updated,  likely to include the new `NewViewComponent`.

Finally, between 1:06 PM and 1:11 PM, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_color_mapping.prompt.md` file was updated multiple times. This file appears to be a prompt to implement a Figma design into the `approval_lib` module. The changes show revisions to the Figma design link  and  removal of context sections.

At 1:12 PM, the  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/ui/screens/copilot_approval_request/presentation/model/approval_request_ui_model.dart` file was updated twice with identical code. This file defines a data model (`ApprovalRequestUiModel`) likely for the UI implementation described in the `ui_color_mapping.prompt.md` file.  The update probably established or modified this data model using the Freezed package for immutability.


## 2:12:58 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, specifically within the `approval_lib` module.  The most significant changes revolve around the `approval_request_ui_model.dart` and `edit_approval_delegation_screen.dart` files.

`approval_request_ui_model.dart` underwent several revisions between 1:13 PM and 1:15 PM.  Initially, it used the `freezed` package for immutable data models. This was later replaced with a standard Dart class that includes a `copyWith` method for easier updates.  The content of the `initial()` factory method remained consistent throughout these changes, always initializing the model with default values for delegation details ("John Smith", current date and time, etc.).

Between 1:22 PM and 1:26 PM, `copilot_approval_request_screen.dart` was updated. This file appears to be a UI screen displaying and allowing edits to an approval request using the `ApprovalRequestUiModel`.  It uses custom UI components from `core_ui` for styling and layout, indicating a consistent design system.

From 1:32 PM to 1:39 PM, multiple edits to `ui_color_mapping.prompt.md` reflect iterative refinement of instructions for implementing a Figma design into the `approval_lib` module. The prompt consistently points to the same Figma design, with updates clarifying that input fields should be editable and the screen should be scrollable.  The target filename for the new screen also evolved during this period, eventually settling on `edit_approval_delegation_screen.dart`.


Finally, `edit_approval_delegation_screen.dart` shows the implementation of the UI screen based on the prompt.  Between 1:40 PM and 1:42 PM, minor edits to this file were made, but no significant functional changes are visible in this snippet. The code suggests a screen for managing approval delegation, featuring fields for selecting a delegate, setting start/end dates and times, and adding notes. It utilizes date/time pickers and a modal bottom sheet for user selection.  The update process is currently simulated with a `Future.delayed` call.
