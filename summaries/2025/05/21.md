# Activity Summary for 5/21/2025

## 9:12:49 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/delegate_approval_get_request.prompt.md` between 8:17 AM and 8:39 AM on May 21, 2025.  These edits refine a prompt used to generate code, seemingly for a data layer. The prompt iteratively refines the input parameters, specifying a module name (`approval_lib`) and directing the code generation to retrieve API information from  `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/delegate_approval/delegate_approval.md`,  `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/delegate_approval/detail/success.json`, and `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/delegate_approval/detail/success_empty.json`.  Additional constraints are added, including the absence of query parameters and enums, mandatory ID fields, and the lack of default values. The final prompt also specifies that the generated code should interact with a repository named `approvals_repository.dart`, with an implementation file named `approvals_repository_impl.dart`.

Between 8:24 AM and 8:50 AM,  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/approval_remote_constants.dart` underwent multiple edits. These changes appear to be minor and involve no substantial alterations to the content of the file, which defines constants likely related to API endpoints and request parameters for approval management.  The `getApprovalDelegationPath` constant is added or modified during this period.  The repeated edits to this file suggest minor adjustments or attempts to correct formatting rather than substantial functional changes.  Finally, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/delegatee_api_model.dart` shows minor updates between 8:26 AM and 8:29 AM, but the content remains largely unchanged; a simple data model using `json_annotation`.  The  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/repository/approvals_repository.dart` file is updated at 8:37 AM, defining an interface for an approval repository.


## 11:12:56 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/approval_remote_constants.dart` file between 10:39:06 AM and 11:12:31 AM on May 21, 2025.  These changes appear to be minor edits, with no significant alterations to the content of the API paths or constants defined within the `ApprovalRemoteConstants` class.  The repeated edits suggest iterative refinement or minor bug fixes rather than substantial feature additions.


A `data_layer_codegen.prompt.md` file (10:19:18 AM) details a process for generating Flutter data layer code, outlining steps to gather user input (module details, API request and response specifics, including enums and date/time fields), parse that input, present it for confirmation, and finally generate the code components (API constants, request/response models, mappers, remote data source, and repository). This appears to be a template for automated code generation.

Multiple entries for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/delegate_approval_get_request.prompt.md` exist (between 10:36:16 AM and 11:01:22 AM), indicating repeated attempts to refine instructions for generating data layer code related to delegate approvals within the `approval_lib` module.  The changes involve clarifying the location of mapper files and confirming the usage of an existing prompt file (`data_layer_codegen_visual.prompt.md`), suggesting iterative improvement of the code generation process.  The core instructions consistently involve using API information from specific files within the `freshservice_mobile_api_mock` directory.


Finally, a `copilot-instructions.md` file (multiple entries between 10:58:55 AM and 11:01:22 AM) provides guidelines for using GitHub Copilot within the Freshservice Flutter project.  These instructions emphasize adherence to Clean Architecture, BLoC pattern, specific naming conventions, and the use of build tools like `freezed` and `json_serializable`. The repeated edits refined instructions for generating `.freezed.dart` and `.g.dart` files, and clarified the use of `build_runner`. The instructions highlight a strong emphasis on maintaining code quality and modularity.
