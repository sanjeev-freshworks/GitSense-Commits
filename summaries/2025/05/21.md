# Activity Summary for 5/21/2025

## 9:12:49 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/delegate_approval_get_request.prompt.md` between 8:17 AM and 8:39 AM on May 21, 2025.  These edits refine a prompt used to generate code, seemingly for a data layer. The prompt iteratively refines the input parameters, specifying a module name (`approval_lib`) and directing the code generation to retrieve API information from  `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/delegate_approval/delegate_approval.md`,  `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/delegate_approval/detail/success.json`, and `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/delegate_approval/detail/success_empty.json`.  Additional constraints are added, including the absence of query parameters and enums, mandatory ID fields, and the lack of default values. The final prompt also specifies that the generated code should interact with a repository named `approvals_repository.dart`, with an implementation file named `approvals_repository_impl.dart`.

Between 8:24 AM and 8:50 AM,  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/approval_remote_constants.dart` underwent multiple edits. These changes appear to be minor and involve no substantial alterations to the content of the file, which defines constants likely related to API endpoints and request parameters for approval management.  The `getApprovalDelegationPath` constant is added or modified during this period.  The repeated edits to this file suggest minor adjustments or attempts to correct formatting rather than substantial functional changes.  Finally, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/delegatee_api_model.dart` shows minor updates between 8:26 AM and 8:29 AM, but the content remains largely unchanged; a simple data model using `json_annotation`.  The  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/repository/approvals_repository.dart` file is updated at 8:37 AM, defining an interface for an approval repository.


## 11:12:56 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/approval_remote_constants.dart` file between 10:39:06 AM and 11:12:31 AM on May 21, 2025.  These changes appear to be minor edits, with no significant alterations to the content of the API paths or constants defined within the `ApprovalRemoteConstants` class.  The repeated edits suggest iterative refinement or minor bug fixes rather than substantial feature additions.


A `data_layer_codegen.prompt.md` file (10:19:18 AM) details a process for generating Flutter data layer code, outlining steps to gather user input (module details, API request and response specifics, including enums and date/time fields), parse that input, present it for confirmation, and finally generate the code components (API constants, request/response models, mappers, remote data source, and repository). This appears to be a template for automated code generation.

Multiple entries for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/delegate_approval_get_request.prompt.md` exist (between 10:36:16 AM and 11:01:22 AM), indicating repeated attempts to refine instructions for generating data layer code related to delegate approvals within the `approval_lib` module.  The changes involve clarifying the location of mapper files and confirming the usage of an existing prompt file (`data_layer_codegen_visual.prompt.md`), suggesting iterative improvement of the code generation process.  The core instructions consistently involve using API information from specific files within the `freshservice_mobile_api_mock` directory.


Finally, a `copilot-instructions.md` file (multiple entries between 10:58:55 AM and 11:01:22 AM) provides guidelines for using GitHub Copilot within the Freshservice Flutter project.  These instructions emphasize adherence to Clean Architecture, BLoC pattern, specific naming conventions, and the use of build tools like `freezed` and `json_serializable`. The repeated edits refined instructions for generating `.freezed.dart` and `.g.dart` files, and clarified the use of `build_runner`. The instructions highlight a strong emphasis on maintaining code quality and modularity.


## 12:12:54 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib` directory, specifically within the `approval_remote_constants.dart` file and  `approval_lib.dart` file.  The majority of changes between 11:13 AM and 11:16 AM in `approval_remote_constants.dart`  appear to be insignificant, reflecting minor edits or no changes at all in the code content itself.

A significant change occurs around 11:44 AM in `approval_remote_constants.dart`, where the constant `getDelegationDetail` is added with the API path  `'api/_/profile/approval_delegation'`.  Further modifications to  `approval_remote_constants.dart` between 11:46 AM and 11:51 AM show further minor, seemingly inconsequential edits.  At 11:55 AM, the constant `getDelegationDetail` remains, but the  `getApprovalContent` is retained, and there is no `getDelegationDetail` constant.

The `approval_lib.dart` file is updated at 12:11 PM, primarily adding model exports related to delegation (`delegation.dart`, `delegatee.dart`, `delegation_detail.dart`). This strongly suggests the introduction of a new feature or functionality related to approval delegations.

The creation of  `delegation_api_model_mapper.dart` at 11:54 AM and several consecutive updates to `delegation_detail.dart` between 12:06 PM and 12:09 PM indicate the implementation of data models and mappers for handling delegation data.  The repeated edits to `delegation_detail.dart` might point to iterative refinement of the data model. The creation of `delegatee_api_model.dart` at 12:01 PM supports this.

In summary, the key changes revolve around adding support for fetching and processing delegation details, potentially a new feature within the approval workflow.  The frequent, minor edits to `approval_remote_constants.dart` may indicate debugging or minor adjustments during development.  The addition of delegation-related models to `approval_lib.dart` reinforces this conclusion.  The other file, `copilot-instructions.md`, provides context about the project's structure and coding guidelines.


## 1:12:47 PM
The log shows development activity within the `mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, focusing on the `approval_lib` module.  The initial entry at 12:25 PM is a comprehensive document outlining project structure, coding conventions, and guidelines for using Copilot. This document details a modular monorepo structure using Melos, Clean Architecture, BLoC pattern for state management, and specific libraries for various functionalities.  It emphasizes strong typing, null safety, and thorough testing.

At 12:26 PM, a prompt is logged for code generation related to fetching approval delegation details from a specified API endpoint.  The prompt specifies input parameters, expected output formats, and file locations for generated code.  Between 12:28 PM and 1:08 PM, there were multiple identical commits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/approvals_remote_constants.dart`. This file defines a constant string `"api/_/profile/approval_delegation"` representing the API path for retrieving approval delegations.  The repeated commits suggest potential issues with the version control system or accidental repetitive saves. The final version of this file contains the API path, indicating the successful completion of adding the API endpoint.


## 2:12:46 PM
The log shows two entries for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/approvals_remote_constants.dart` on May 21, 2025.  Both entries at 1:48:45 PM and 1:49:01 PM contain identical code defining a class `ApprovalsRemoteConstants` with a single constant `getApprovalDelegation`  pointing to the API path "api/_/profile/approval_delegation".  The changes between these two timestamps are insignificant and likely represent a negligible update or a version control artifact rather than a substantive code modification.


## 3:12:56 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib` library between 2:19 PM and 3:05 PM on May 21, 2025.  The changes revolve around implementing approval delegation functionalities.

Initially, several updates to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/delegate_approval_post_request.prompt.md`  occurred within a short time frame (2:19:36 PM to 2:20:05 PM). These changes modified prompts for code generation, alternating between specifying "Get Delegation Detail" and "Create Approval Delegation" as the target implementation. The other parts of the prompt remain consistent, pointing to the same API information sources and specifying that only one function should be implemented at a time (`approvals_repository.dart`, `approvals_repository_impl.dart`).

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/approval_remote_constants.dart` underwent multiple revisions (2:27:57 PM - 3:05:32 PM).  These edits involved adding and removing API endpoints related to approval delegation (`approvalDelegation`).  The final version removed the duplicated endpoints, resulting in one for both `getDelegationDetail` and `createApprovalDelegation`.

The `approvals_repository.dart` file (2:28:41 PM - 2:29:58 PM) was updated to include the `getDelegationDetail` and `createDelegation` functions within the `ApprovalsRepository` interface, signifying the addition of approval delegation methods.  The `createDelegation` function accepts a `delegateeId` and optional `notes`. There were multiple edits to this file with no changes in the code.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/approval_remote_data_source.dart`  also saw multiple revisions (2:30:04 PM - 2:50:07 PM), adding the implementation of these delegation functions within the `ApprovalRemoteDataSource` class. These changes involved using the API endpoints defined in `approval_remote_constants.dart` to make network calls.

A new file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/request/create_delegation_request.dart`, was introduced (2:30:54 PM, 2:33:19 PM) and appears to be a data model for creating a delegation request. There were multiple edits to this file with no changes in the code.

Finally, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/model/response/approval_delegation.dart` (2:38:00 PM - 2:41:36 PM) was created and then modified several times without any changes in the code, likely refining a data model for the approval delegation response using the `freezed` package.

The repeated edits in `approval_remote_constants.dart` and  `approval_delegation.dart` without code changes suggest iterative refinement and potential debugging or refactoring of the code.  The overall pattern reveals a focused effort on adding and solidifying the approval delegation feature in the approval library.  The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/delegate_approval_get_request.prompt.md` file was updated at 2:52:27 PM with a prompt similar to previous prompts, but again seemingly focused on code generation and the creation of approval delegations.


## 4:13:06 PM
The log shows a series of code changes and file modifications related to a Freshservice mobile application's UI design system.  The updates span from 3:22 PM to 4:12 PM on May 21, 2025.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/figma_fsds_core`  was updated at 3:22:40 PM. This file appears to contain Figma design data, including components, nodes, and their properties (fills, layout, text styles, etc.). The data describes a design system's core elements, colors and components like a cover image with a logo and text.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/color_map.md` was updated twice at 3:24:33 PM and 3:24:43 PM, reflecting a change in the Figma file referenced for color mappings. Initially it pointed to 'figma', and subsequently was changed to  'figma_fsds_core'.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_explain.prompt.md` was modified multiple times between 3:26:02 PM and 3:26:53 PM,  illustrating adjustments in the file path to include the  `color_map.instructions.md` file, likely a markdown file with instructions regarding color mapping.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/figma_fsds_mobile_specs` was modified at 3:31:00 PM and again at 3:36:41 PM.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_explain_design_components.prompt.md` shows many updates between 3:33:40 PM and 3:59:12 PM demonstrating iterative refinement of prompts related to explaining and implementing design components. The prompt evolves from a simple explanation request to a more structured, multi-step instruction involving color mapping and button implementation in the `fs_ui_catalog_app` directory.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/experiment/progress_indicator_component.dart` shows minor edits between 3:50:09 PM and 3:52:08 PM, indicating no significant functional changes to the progress indicator component itself.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/experiment/status_badge_component.dart`  is added at 3:52:55 PM which is a  Flutter component for displaying status badges.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/color_mapping.instructions.md` was heavily revised between 3:55:19 PM and 4:12:38 PM,  providing clearer color mapping instructions between Figma and the Flutter codebase, even including examples.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/theme/colors/constants/fs_color_palette.dart` undergoes several modifications from 3:57:05 PM to 3:59:43 PM, refining a  Flutter color palette with various color shades.  The  `void x(BuildContext context)` function is a placeholder; its purpose isn't clear.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/experiment/fs_button.dart` was edited several times between 4:02:43 PM and 4:03:27 PM. This shows the creation of a customizable button component for the app.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/fs_button_catalog_screen.dart` was added at 4:04:44 PM and then edited at 4:05:32 PM. This file likely creates a screen to showcase the different types of buttons.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG`  shows commit messages that reflect the addition of button components and related files, as well as some uncommitted changes in the UI development process.  The commit message revisions indicate difficulties or unexpected results in the automated UI generation.

In summary, the log tracks the development and refinement of a Freshservice mobile app's UI, focusing on color mapping and button implementation using Figma specifications and Flutter.  There's evidence of iterative refinement of prompts for AI assistance, and iterative improvements in the code as the development proceeds.


## 5:12:49 PM
The log shows a series of code and document modifications related to a Flutter project's UI design system, specifically focusing on color mapping and design component implementation.

Between 4:13:10 PM and 4:13:37 PM, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/color_mapping.instructions.md` file underwent minor revisions.  The core content remained consistent: instructions on how Figma colors are mapped to the Flutter codebase, referencing several Dart files within the `libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/theme` directory.  These files handle color constants, palettes, themes (light and dark), and typography.  An example mapping from Figma hex codes to the Flutter `context.theme.fsColorScheme` was provided.  The only changes were minor edits to the concluding sentence, adding more clarity regarding referencing the example files.


From 4:15:24 PM to 4:16:07 PM, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_explain_design_components.prompt.md` file was modified. This file outlines a four-step process:  explaining Figma design system and color mappings (referencing other instruction files), implementing various button types from Figma designs within a specific directory (`apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/experiment`), and showcasing the implemented components using separate instructions.  The main change was the addition and then removal of the implementation of buttons in step 3.

At 4:16:27 PM and then 4:17:19 PM, the  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/model/freshservice_components_elements.dart` file was updated. This file defines an enum `FreshserviceComponentsElements`. The  `buttonComponent` element was removed in the second commit.


Finally, between 4:18:32 PM and 4:18:55 PM, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_explain_colors.prompt.md` file was edited. The file's purpose is to explain Figma design data, specifically referencing `design_system_map.instructions.md` and `color_map.instructions.md`. The changes involved clarifying the request from a brief explanation to a detailed explanation.

In summary, the code changes reflect an iterative process of refining documentation for UI design system implementation within a Flutter project.  The focus was primarily on documenting color mapping and guiding the implementation of UI components.  The modifications to the `freshservice_components_elements.dart` file suggest that the button component was initially included and later removed, potentially indicating a change in design or implementation plan.


## 6:13:06 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the development of an approval delegation feature within a Flutter application interacting with a Freshservice API.  The modifications span several files and revolve around data layer generation, API definitions, and data model mappings.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/delegate_approval_post_request.prompt.md` file underwent multiple revisions between 5:15 PM and 5:53 PM on May 21, 2025. These revisions refined the prompt for a code generation tool ([data_layer_codegen](data_layer_codegen_visual.prompt.md)),  specifically focusing on the  `Create Approval Delegation` functionality. The key changes in this prompt involved clarifying the API information source and the inclusion of a sample request body.  The final version (5:53 PM) explicitly stated that the code should handle both agent and requester scenarios and included instructions for handling file modifications.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/approval_remote_constants.dart` file was updated twice (5:19 PM and 5:54 PM) to define API endpoints. The later update (5:54 PM) added paths for  `updateDelegationAgentPath` and `updateDelegationRequesterPath`, reflecting the addition of an update functionality for approval delegation.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/approval_remote_data_source.dart` file was modified multiple times (5:41 PM - 5:49 PM) to include  functions related to approval delegation, such as `createAgentDelegation`, `createRequesterDelegation`, `updateAgentDelegation`, and `updateRequesterDelegation`. This suggests a significant expansion of the data source's capabilities.  The file remained largely unchanged in structure during subsequent revisions.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/repository/impl/approvals_repository_impl.dart` file was updated twice (6:00 PM and 6:00 PM), adding methods `createAgentDelegation` and `createRequesterDelegation` to the `ApprovalsRepositoryImpl` class.  These changes directly reflect the implementation of the newly added delegation creation functionality in the data source.

Several files related to data model mappers (`approval_delegation_response_api_model_mapper.dart`, `delegation_api_model_mapper.dart`) show repeated edits with no code changes, suggesting potential issues with version control or accidental commits.

The  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/delegate_approval_get_request.prompt.md` file was updated several times between 5:27 PM and 5:37 PM.  The main change was a shift from focusing solely on `Create Approval Delegation` to implementing `Get Delegation Detail` for both agent and requester. The final version clearly specified separate API endpoints for agent and requester and updated the data source file names.


Finally, new data models were introduced:  `create_delegation_request.dart` and `update_delegation_request.dart` (around 5:57 PM and 6:12 PM) to handle the request and response for creating and updating the approval delegations. The `delegation_update_methods.dart` file was created (6:10 PM) to house methods for handling delegation updates.

In summary, the log documents the iterative development of the approval delegation feature, progressing from initial design and code generation prompts to the implementation of both GET and POST (Create/Update) functionalities for both agent and requester roles.  The code heavily relies on mappers and helper classes for API interaction, and a significant portion of the changes concern refining the API interaction. The repeated commits to mapper files might need investigation.
