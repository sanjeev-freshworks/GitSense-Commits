# Activity Summary for 5/21/2025

## 9:12:49 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/delegate_approval_get_request.prompt.md` between 8:17 AM and 8:39 AM on May 21, 2025.  These edits refine a prompt used to generate code, seemingly for a data layer. The prompt iteratively refines the input parameters, specifying a module name (`approval_lib`) and directing the code generation to retrieve API information from  `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/delegate_approval/delegate_approval.md`,  `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/delegate_approval/detail/success.json`, and `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/delegate_approval/detail/success_empty.json`.  Additional constraints are added, including the absence of query parameters and enums, mandatory ID fields, and the lack of default values. The final prompt also specifies that the generated code should interact with a repository named `approvals_repository.dart`, with an implementation file named `approvals_repository_impl.dart`.

Between 8:24 AM and 8:50 AM,  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/approval_remote_constants.dart` underwent multiple edits. These changes appear to be minor and involve no substantial alterations to the content of the file, which defines constants likely related to API endpoints and request parameters for approval management.  The `getApprovalDelegationPath` constant is added or modified during this period.  The repeated edits to this file suggest minor adjustments or attempts to correct formatting rather than substantial functional changes.  Finally, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/delegatee_api_model.dart` shows minor updates between 8:26 AM and 8:29 AM, but the content remains largely unchanged; a simple data model using `json_annotation`.  The  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/repository/approvals_repository.dart` file is updated at 8:37 AM, defining an interface for an approval repository.


## 11:12:56 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/approval_remote_constants.dart` file between 10:39:06 AM and 11:12:31 AM on May 21, 2025.  These changes appear to be minor edits, with no significant alterations to the content of the API paths or constants defined within the `ApprovalRemoteConstants` class.  The repeated edits suggest iterative refinement or minor bug fixes rather than substantial feature additions.


A `data_layer_codegen.prompt.md` file (10:19:18 AM) details a process for generating Flutter data layer code, outlining steps to gather user input (module details, API request and response specifics, including enums and date/time fields), parse that input, present it for confirmation, and finally generate the code components (API constants, request/response models, mappers, remote data source, and repository). This appears to be a template for automated code generation.

Multiple entries for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/delegate_approval_get_request.prompt.md` exist (between 10:36:16 AM and 11:01:22 AM), indicating repeated attempts to refine instructions for generating data layer code related to delegate approvals within the `approval_lib` module.  The changes involve clarifying the location of mapper files and confirming the usage of an existing prompt file (`data_layer_codegen_visual.prompt.md`), suggesting iterative improvement of the code generation process.  The core instructions consistently involve using API information from specific files within the `freshservice_mobile_api_mock` directory.


Finally, a `copilot-instructions.md` file (multiple entries between 10:58:55 AM and 11:01:22 AM) provides guidelines for using GitHub Copilot within the Freshservice Flutter project.  These instructions emphasize adherence to Clean Architecture, BLoC pattern, specific naming conventions, and the use of build tools like `freezed` and `json_serializable`. The repeated edits refined instructions for generating `.freezed.dart` and `.g.dart` files, and clarified the use of `build_runner`. The instructions highlight a strong emphasis on maintaining code quality and modularity.


## 12:12:54 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib` directory, specifically within the `approval_remote_constants.dart` file and  `approval_lib.dart` file.  The majority of changes between 11:13 AM and 11:16 AM in `approval_remote_constants.dart`  appear to be insignificant, reflecting minor edits or no changes at all in the code content itself.

A significant change occurs around 11:44 AM in `approval_remote_constants.dart`, where the constant `getDelegationDetail` is added with the API path  `'api/_/profile/approval_delegation'`.  Further modifications to  `approval_remote_constants.dart` between 11:46 AM and 11:51 AM show further minor, seemingly inconsequential edits.  At 11:55 AM, the constant `getDelegationDetail` remains, but the  `getApprovalContent` is retained, and there is no `getDelegationDetail` constant.

The `approval_lib.dart` file is updated at 12:11 PM, primarily adding model exports related to delegation (`delegation.dart`, `delegatee.dart`, `delegation_detail.dart`). This strongly suggests the introduction of a new feature or functionality related to approval delegations.

The creation of  `delegation_api_model_mapper.dart` at 11:54 AM and several consecutive updates to `delegation_detail.dart` between 12:06 PM and 12:09 PM indicate the implementation of data models and mappers for handling delegation data.  The repeated edits to `delegation_detail.dart` might point to iterative refinement of the data model. The creation of `delegatee_api_model.dart` at 12:01 PM supports this.

In summary, the key changes revolve around adding support for fetching and processing delegation details, potentially a new feature within the approval workflow.  The frequent, minor edits to `approval_remote_constants.dart` may indicate debugging or minor adjustments during development.  The addition of delegation-related models to `approval_lib.dart` reinforces this conclusion.  The other file, `copilot-instructions.md`, provides context about the project's structure and coding guidelines.


## 1:12:47 PM
The log shows development activity within the `mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, focusing on the `approval_lib` module.  The initial entry at 12:25 PM is a comprehensive document outlining project structure, coding conventions, and guidelines for using Copilot. This document details a modular monorepo structure using Melos, Clean Architecture, BLoC pattern for state management, and specific libraries for various functionalities.  It emphasizes strong typing, null safety, and thorough testing.

At 12:26 PM, a prompt is logged for code generation related to fetching approval delegation details from a specified API endpoint.  The prompt specifies input parameters, expected output formats, and file locations for generated code.  Between 12:28 PM and 1:08 PM, there were multiple identical commits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/approvals_remote_constants.dart`. This file defines a constant string `"api/_/profile/approval_delegation"` representing the API path for retrieving approval delegations.  The repeated commits suggest potential issues with the version control system or accidental repetitive saves. The final version of this file contains the API path, indicating the successful completion of adding the API endpoint.


## 2:12:46 PM
The log shows two entries for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/approvals_remote_constants.dart` on May 21, 2025.  Both entries at 1:48:45 PM and 1:49:01 PM contain identical code defining a class `ApprovalsRemoteConstants` with a single constant `getApprovalDelegation`  pointing to the API path "api/_/profile/approval_delegation".  The changes between these two timestamps are insignificant and likely represent a negligible update or a version control artifact rather than a substantive code modification.
