# Activity Summary for 5/21/2025

## 9:12:49 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/delegate_approval_get_request.prompt.md` between 8:17 AM and 8:39 AM on May 21, 2025.  These edits refine a prompt used to generate code, seemingly for a data layer. The prompt iteratively refines the input parameters, specifying a module name (`approval_lib`) and directing the code generation to retrieve API information from  `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/delegate_approval/delegate_approval.md`,  `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/delegate_approval/detail/success.json`, and `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/delegate_approval/detail/success_empty.json`.  Additional constraints are added, including the absence of query parameters and enums, mandatory ID fields, and the lack of default values. The final prompt also specifies that the generated code should interact with a repository named `approvals_repository.dart`, with an implementation file named `approvals_repository_impl.dart`.

Between 8:24 AM and 8:50 AM,  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/approval_remote_constants.dart` underwent multiple edits. These changes appear to be minor and involve no substantial alterations to the content of the file, which defines constants likely related to API endpoints and request parameters for approval management.  The `getApprovalDelegationPath` constant is added or modified during this period.  The repeated edits to this file suggest minor adjustments or attempts to correct formatting rather than substantial functional changes.  Finally, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/delegatee_api_model.dart` shows minor updates between 8:26 AM and 8:29 AM, but the content remains largely unchanged; a simple data model using `json_annotation`.  The  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/repository/approvals_repository.dart` file is updated at 8:37 AM, defining an interface for an approval repository.
