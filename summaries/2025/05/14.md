# Activity Summary for 5/14/2025

## 1:35:09 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the development of a "delegate approval" feature within a Flutter application, specifically targeting the data layer.  The changes span from 12:54 PM to 1:14 PM on May 14, 2025.

Initially, there were several revisions of a prompt file (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/get_delegate_approval_data_layer.prompt.md`) between 12:55 PM and 1:00 PM.  These revisions refined the instructions for implementing the data layer, clarifying that only the GET functionality for "Get Delegation Detail" was needed.  The module name was also specified as "approval_lib", and reference to backend contracts was included.

Subsequently, the code files `approval_remote_constants.dart` and `delegatee_api_model_mapper.dart` were created or updated at around 1:10 PM and 1:11 PM, respectively.  `approval_remote_constants.dart` defines a class containing various API endpoint constants related to approval functionalities, including paths for fetching delegation details (`getDelegationDetail`). This file underwent multiple revisions in rapid succession between 1:10 PM and 1:11 PM, although the content remained largely unchanged in those revisions.

`delegatee_api_model_mapper.dart` contains a mapper to convert an API model (`DelegateeApiModel`) to a data model (`Delegatee`).

Finally, `delegation_api_model.dart` was created or modified around 1:13 PM and 1:14 PM, and contains a `DelegationApiModel` class annotated with `@JsonSerializable`, suggesting the use of a JSON serialization library for handling API responses.  This class appears to represent the structure of the API response for the delegation details.  Multiple, identical revisions of this file were made between 1:13 and 1:14 PM.

The overall pattern reveals an iterative refinement of specifications and subsequent implementation of the data layer for a delegation approval feature.  The rapid succession of identical file revisions might suggest some technical issue during saving or a version control process.
