# Activity Summary for 5/14/2025

## 1:35:09 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the development of a "delegate approval" feature within a Flutter application, specifically targeting the data layer.  The changes span from 12:54 PM to 1:14 PM on May 14, 2025.

Initially, there were several revisions of a prompt file (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/get_delegate_approval_data_layer.prompt.md`) between 12:55 PM and 1:00 PM.  These revisions refined the instructions for implementing the data layer, clarifying that only the GET functionality for "Get Delegation Detail" was needed.  The module name was also specified as "approval_lib", and reference to backend contracts was included.

Subsequently, the code files `approval_remote_constants.dart` and `delegatee_api_model_mapper.dart` were created or updated at around 1:10 PM and 1:11 PM, respectively.  `approval_remote_constants.dart` defines a class containing various API endpoint constants related to approval functionalities, including paths for fetching delegation details (`getDelegationDetail`). This file underwent multiple revisions in rapid succession between 1:10 PM and 1:11 PM, although the content remained largely unchanged in those revisions.

`delegatee_api_model_mapper.dart` contains a mapper to convert an API model (`DelegateeApiModel`) to a data model (`Delegatee`).

Finally, `delegation_api_model.dart` was created or modified around 1:13 PM and 1:14 PM, and contains a `DelegationApiModel` class annotated with `@JsonSerializable`, suggesting the use of a JSON serialization library for handling API responses.  This class appears to represent the structure of the API response for the delegation details.  Multiple, identical revisions of this file were made between 1:13 and 1:14 PM.

The overall pattern reveals an iterative refinement of specifications and subsequent implementation of the data layer for a delegation approval feature.  The rapid succession of identical file revisions might suggest some technical issue during saving or a version control process.


## 2:35:08 PM
The log shows a series of code changes between 2:15 PM and 2:32 PM on May 14, 2025, primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib` directory.  The most significant changes involve the `approval_remote_data_source.dart` file, which underwent multiple revisions within a short timeframe.  These revisions didn't alter the overall structure or functionality but likely involved bug fixes or minor improvements. The code within this file consists of a Dart class (`ApprovalRemoteDataSource`) that interacts with a remote API for various approval-related operations.  These operations include retrieving approval lists, resending/canceling approvals, managing approval chains and groups, sending emails, and fetching approval details and templates.  The code extensively uses mappers to translate between API models and data models.

A new feature, "delegate approval," is introduced.  The `get_approval_delegation_data_layer.md` file shows multiple edits refining a prompt for implementing this feature's data layer, specifically the "Get Delegation Detail" part.  These edits refined the prompt's instructions and references to related documentation, iteratively improving clarity. Finally, new files were added to support the delegation feature: `delegation_detail.dart`, `delegation_detail_api_model.dart`, and `delegation_api_model_mapper.dart`  These files define data models and mappers for the delegation feature.  The `approval_remote_constants.dart` file received an update at 2:31 PM,  adding a constant for the new delegation detail API endpoint (`getDelegationDetailPath`).
