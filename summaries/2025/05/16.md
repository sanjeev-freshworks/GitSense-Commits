# Activity Summary for 5/16/2025

## 12:37:52 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a markdown file (`data_layer_codegen.prompt.md`), detailing instructions for generating Flutter data layer code from user input.  The file underwent numerous revisions between 12:18 PM and 12:37 PM on May 16, 2025.  The core content remained consistent across all revisions:  a prompt designed to guide users through the process of providing information for code generation. This information includes module details (module name), request details (CURL command, query parameters, request body), and response details (JSON response, mandatory and default fields, enums, date/time fields).

The prompt is structured into four main sections: gathering user input, parsing the input, presenting results for confirmation, and generating code components (API constants, request/response models, mappers, data source, and repository).  A detailed confirmation checklist is provided to ensure data accuracy before code generation.  The prompt also specifies the expected file locations and naming conventions for the generated Dart code, including the use of `json_serializable` and `freezed` annotations.  Several revisions added or refined the "Context" section, which initially only included a package structure diagram, later expanding to include links to additional files providing context on code generation.  One revision briefly included  a section titled "API Path Parameter Format,"  but it was subsequently removed.


## 1:37:53 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a markdown file (`data_layer_codegen.prompt.md`) between 12:37 PM and 12:44 PM on May 16, 2025.  These revisions primarily involve refinements to a prompt for generating Flutter data layer code.  The core functionality remains consistent:  automating the creation of a data layer for a single CRUD API operation based on user-provided input (CURL command, JSON response details, etc.).

The changes across revisions are subtle and iterative, primarily focusing on improving the clarity and structure of the prompt instructions and the confirmation checklist.  There's a significant addition of context files referenced in the prompt,  with several markdown files listed, guiding the code generation process.  These files provide additional instructions relating to API constants, request and response models, data mappers, remote data sources, and repository implementation.  Note that the number of context files referenced increased gradually over the revisions.

Finally, a new `approval_remote_constants.dart` file appears in the log between 12:51 PM and 12:54 PM. This file contains Dart code defining constants for API paths and query parameters related to approvals, suggesting the code generation prompt is being applied to this specific module.  The content of `approval_remote_constants.dart` remains unchanged after the initial commit.  The structure suggests a consistent pattern of creating a constants file for each module within the `data/datasource/remote/helper/` directory.


## 3:37:53 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_color_mapping.prompt.md`  between 3:01 PM and 3:19 PM on May 16, 2025.  These edits primarily refine a prompt for implementing a Figma design screen within the `approval_lib` module of a Flutter mobile application.

The initial prompts focused on color mapping from Figma to the application's color scheme (`fsColorScheme`) and text theme (`fsTextTheme`), referencing several Dart files within the `core_lib/core_ui` directory for color definitions.  Over time, the prompt's wording changed to clarify the task, specifically instructing to only focus on UI implementation based on the Figma design,  using existing components from `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules, and creating new ones in `approval_lib` if necessary. The Figma design file URL remained consistent throughout the edits.  The target directory for the new screen was also specified in later versions of the prompt, ultimately settling on  `approval_lib/lib/src/ui/screens/copilot_approval_request/`.

Finally, a `approval_detail_card.dart` file was added at 3:34:59 PM, showcasing the use of `fsColorScheme` and `fsTextTheme` abstractions in a card component. This component takes title, description, priority, and due date as inputs and dynamically styles itself using the theme extensions.  The `_getPriorityColor` function highlights the use of semantic colors based on the priority level.  The file imports `core_ui` indicating it leverages the previously defined color and text theme definitions.
