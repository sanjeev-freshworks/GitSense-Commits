# Activity Summary for 5/16/2025

## 12:37:52 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a markdown file (`data_layer_codegen.prompt.md`), detailing instructions for generating Flutter data layer code from user input.  The file underwent numerous revisions between 12:18 PM and 12:37 PM on May 16, 2025.  The core content remained consistent across all revisions:  a prompt designed to guide users through the process of providing information for code generation. This information includes module details (module name), request details (CURL command, query parameters, request body), and response details (JSON response, mandatory and default fields, enums, date/time fields).

The prompt is structured into four main sections: gathering user input, parsing the input, presenting results for confirmation, and generating code components (API constants, request/response models, mappers, data source, and repository).  A detailed confirmation checklist is provided to ensure data accuracy before code generation.  The prompt also specifies the expected file locations and naming conventions for the generated Dart code, including the use of `json_serializable` and `freezed` annotations.  Several revisions added or refined the "Context" section, which initially only included a package structure diagram, later expanding to include links to additional files providing context on code generation.  One revision briefly included  a section titled "API Path Parameter Format,"  but it was subsequently removed.
