# Activity Summary for 5/29/2025

## 12:11:50 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a single markdown file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/instructions/ui_codegen_guidelines.instructions.md`.  All revisions made between 11:12:50 AM and 11:20:46 AM on May 29, 2025, contain identical content.  The file is a comprehensive guide for mapping UI components from Figma designs to Freshservice Flutter components. It emphasizes using existing components from `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules and adhering to clean architecture, theme-driven design, consistent naming, responsive design, and accessibility best practices.  The document details component mapping for buttons, input fields, form controls (checkbox, radio button, toggle/switch), search fields, content display (tags, chips, avatar), and dialog/modal components, providing example Dart code snippets for each.  There is no discernible pattern of iterative changes within the tracked revisions.


## 3:22:39 PM
The log shows several modifications to a markdown file (`ui_codegen_guidelines.instructions.md`) detailing UI component mapping guidelines between Figma designs and Freshservice Flutter components.  These changes, occurring between 2:45 PM and 2:48 PM, consist of minor edits and formatting adjustments to the document's content; the core guidelines remain consistent throughout these revisions.  No substantial content changes are observed during this period.


Subsequently, a `message_component.dart` file undergoes multiple revisions (2:50 PM - 2:59 PM).  These changes focus primarily on styling, updating color and text theme references using the `context.theme` object from the `core_ui` library, reflecting a shift in the styling approach.  The text color is repeatedly modified between `context.theme.fsColorScheme.content.primary`, `context.theme.fsColorScheme.textAndIcon.textPrimary`, and `context.theme.fsColorScheme.text.secondary`,  indicating experimentation with color schemes.  The `FSCard` widget is replaced with a `Container` with a `BoxDecoration`, suggesting a move towards more direct styling.  The `onActionPressed` callback is also given a default empty callback (`() {}`).


A `message_component_catalog_screen.dart` file is also briefly modified (2:58 PM), showing a simple update likely related to the changes made in `message_component.dart`.  The file displays usage example for the `MessageComponent`.


Finally, changes are made to  `approval_delegation_banner_component.dart` (3:06 PM - 3:07 PM), `approval_delegation_banner.dart` (3:09 PM - 3:13 PM), and `approval_list_component.dart` (3:19 PM - 3:21 PM) files. These files introduce new components showing that the `FSTag` component is utilized and the design for the approval components are finalized.  The `_ApprovalItem`  widget in  `approval_list_component.dart` uses a `switch` statement for styling based on priority, demonstrating conditional styling.  The `_buildPriorityTag` function is updated to use `FSTag` widgets from `core_ui` for improved code clarity and consistency with the design system.  Button sizes are also standardized.


The `screen_figma.json` and `screen_figma.dart` files (2:59 PM - 3:16 PM) show the evolution of the UI design, primarily in the format of the data.  The final Dart code represents a more structured and detailed representation of the UI component. The initial JSON data is eventually translated into a more complete Flutter widget tree in the `screen_figma.dart` file.  This illustrates the process of code generation from a Figma design.


The `ui_codegen.prompt.md` file (3:03 PM - 3:15 PM) acts as a prompt or instruction document, outlining a multi-step process for code generation. This process involves analyzing the Figma design, mapping components to existing UI modules, implementing the component in the `fs_ui_catalog_app` module, showcasing it, and finally fixing any errors.  The prompt undergoes revisions, clarifying the expectations and constraints for the component implementation (e.g., should be a stateless widget with no state management logic).


## 5:47:39 PM
The log shows several code changes across two Dart files within a Flutter project on May 29th, 2025.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/approval_list_component.dart` file underwent minor revisions between 3:22:59 PM and 3:23:35 PM.  These changes primarily involved refining the `_buildPriorityTag` function within the `_ApprovalItem` class. Specifically, the initial version had a `case 'urgent': return FSTag;` which was updated to combine the 'urgent' and 'high' cases into a single `FSTag.errorTag(label: priority);`.  No other substantial alterations were made to the code's structure or functionality.

The  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/components/approval_card.dart` file was modified multiple times between 3:26:56 PM and 3:27:54 PM. However, these changes appear to be insignificant, reflecting no alterations in the code itself during those revisions.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/temp_prompts/screen_figma.dart` file was updated three times between 3:24:48 PM and 3:25:02 PM. The modifications seem to be related to code formatting or minor adjustments within a long `Container` widget. There are no functional changes observed across these revisions. The repeated code snippets suggest these could be experimental changes or iterations of the same UI component.
