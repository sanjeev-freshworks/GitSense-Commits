# Activity Summary for 5/15/2025

This document details a process for generating Flutter data layer code from user input describing a single CRUD API operation.  The process is broken down into four steps: gathering user input, parsing that input, presenting a confirmation summary to the user, and finally, generating the code.

**Step 1: Gathering User Input** requires detailed information about the module (name), the API request (CURL command, query parameters, including any enums), and the API response (JSON, mandatory and default fields, enums, and date/time fields).

**Step 2: Parsing User Input** extracts key elements from the provided CURL command, such as the HTTP method, API path, query parameters, and request body.

**Step 3: User Confirmation** presents a comprehensive summary of the gathered information for user review and allows for edits before proceeding.  This step uses a checklist to ensure all necessary details are confirmed.

**Step 4: Code Generation** outlines a step-by-step process for generating various code components: API constants (`{module}_remote_constants.dart`), request and response models (including enums and mappers), and finally the remote data source and repository (interface and implementation).  The code generation adheres to specific file location and naming conventions.  Existing files are updated, and new files are created as needed, following the module-based organization.  The provided example uses the `ticket` module and demonstrates the entire workflow.  Guidelines for each component's generation are referenced using several Markdown files within the `/context/data` directory.  The example shows how enum parameters and fields are handled, as well as the treatment of mandatory and default fields in the response.  The constant generation strictly follows the API string values and avoids modification of existing constants with different values, instead opting to create new ones.

The log details a single entry for a markdown file (`data_layer_codegen.prompt.md`) updated on May 15, 2025, at 10:54:18 AM.  This file outlines a prompt for generating Flutter data layer code based on user input describing a single CRUD API operation.

The prompt guides the user through several steps: gathering input (module details, request details including curl command, response details including JSON response, mandatory and default fields, enums and date/time fields), parsing this input to extract HTTP method, API path, parameters and body, presenting a confirmation checklist for user review and allowing edits to specific sections, and finally generating code components (API constants, request and response models, mappers, data source, and repository).

The prompt provides detailed instructions and examples for each step, including naming conventions and file locations for generated code.  It also lists several reference files (located in the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/context/data/` directory)  that provide further context and guidelines for code generation.  An example is included demonstrating user input for a "ticket" module, showcasing a curl command, JSON response, and specification of enums and date/time fields.  Rules for API constant generation (file location, naming conventions) are explicitly laid out.
