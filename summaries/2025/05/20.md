# Activity Summary for 5/20/2025

## 11:18:10 AM
On May 20, 2025, at 11:11:09 AM, a documentation file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/color_mapping.instructions.md`, was updated.  This update provides links to Figma design files outlining color mappings and design components used in the Freshservice mobile Flutter application.  The document also lists several Dart files within the `../../../libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/theme` directory that define color palettes, color schemes, and typography for the application, indicating how Figma colors are implemented in the Flutter codebase.  These files include specifications for light and dark themes (`dark_fs_colors.dart`, `light_fs_colors.dart`), constants (`fs_color_constants.dart`, `fs_color_palette.dart`),  schemes (`fs_color_scheme.dart`, `material_color_scheme.dart`), text themes (`fs_text_theme.dart`, `fs_typography.dart`), and dimensions (`dimen.dart`). The update primarily serves as a guide to the color and design system used in the project.
