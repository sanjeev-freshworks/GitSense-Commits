# Activity Summary for 5/20/2025

## 11:18:10 AM
On May 20, 2025, at 11:11:09 AM, a documentation file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/color_mapping.instructions.md`, was updated.  This update provides links to Figma design files outlining color mappings and design components used in the Freshservice mobile Flutter application.  The document also lists several Dart files within the `../../../libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/theme` directory that define color palettes, color schemes, and typography for the application, indicating how Figma colors are implemented in the Flutter codebase.  These files include specifications for light and dark themes (`dark_fs_colors.dart`, `light_fs_colors.dart`), constants (`fs_color_constants.dart`, `fs_color_palette.dart`),  schemes (`fs_color_scheme.dart`, `material_color_scheme.dart`), text themes (`fs_text_theme.dart`, `fs_typography.dart`), and dimensions (`dimen.dart`). The update primarily serves as a guide to the color and design system used in the project.


## 12:18:13 PM
The log shows a series of edits primarily focused on updating documentation related to UI design and implementation within a Flutter project.  The updates span approximately 15 minutes on May 20, 2025.

Several files within the `.github/context/ui` directory were repeatedly modified between 12:00 PM and 12:02 PM. These modifications were centered around refining instructions for mapping Figma design components to the Flutter codebase. The final version points to the `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules for UI component references.

The `color_mapping.instructions.md` file (first modified at 11:59 AM) provides links to a Figma design file and lists several Dart files (`fs_color_constants.dart`, `fs_color_palette.dart`, etc.) within the `core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/theme` directory that handle color mappings in the Flutter project.  A later update at 12:16 PM added a note to ask for help if color mapping is problematic.

The `design_components_mapping.instructions.md` file (first updated at 12:00 PM) provides a Figma design link and initially lacked a reference to the relevant code.  Subsequent edits added links and clarified that the mapping is present in `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules.

The `ui_color_mapping.prompt.md` file underwent numerous revisions between 12:03 PM and 12:16 PM. These changes involved clarifying the steps for implementing a Figma design, specifically adding references to both `color_mapping.instructions.md` and `design_components_mapping.instructions.md`  for color and component mapping respectively. The instructions also emphasize using existing components from `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules and creating new ones in the `approval_lib` module if necessary.  The file also had its Figma link updated at 12:15 PM.

Finally, two files, `edit_delegation_screen.dart` and `edit_delegation_component.dart`  show code related to a delegation screen.  `edit_delegation_screen.dart` contains the UI code (updated twice with no functional changes between 12:11 PM and 12:11 PM), and `edit_delegation_component.dart` demonstrates its integration into a UI catalog app (updated once at 12:12 PM).  These files demonstrate the practical application of the design and color system.


## 1:18:13 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Figma design implementation prompt and several updates to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib` Dart library.

The `ui_color_mapping.prompt.md` file was repeatedly updated between 12:19 PM and 12:49 PM with minor edits, primarily clarifying the wording in Step 1 of the prompt instructions. The Figma link in the prompt changed from `node-id=27632-10492` to `node-id=27632-10677` at approximately 12:43 PM, suggesting a switch to a different section of the design.


The `edit_delegation_screen.dart` file underwent significant changes between 12:21 PM and 12:23 PM.  These revisions involved refactoring the styling using a consistent `theme.fsTextTheme`  and `theme.fsColorScheme`, changing the AppBar background color from `.fill.background` to `.fill.surface`, and updating text styles from `headlineMedium` and `bodyLarge` to more specific references like `theme.fsTextTheme.semibold.title` and `theme.fsTextTheme.regular.body`. The background and border colors were also updated to use the new theme scheme.  No functional changes seem present in the logic.

The `approval_lib.dart` file was modified multiple times between 12:34 PM and 12:58 PM. These changes consistently involved adding new exports. Specifically,  `src/ui/approvals_list` files were added, suggesting the addition of a new approvals list feature in the UI. These additions indicate an expansion of the library's functionality to include components related to approval lists, including a new page (`approvals_page.dart`), UI model (`approvals_ui_model.dart`), and UI components (`approval_card.dart` and `delegated_approvals_banner.dart`).

The `localizations_ar.dart` file was unchanged in its two recorded revisions, indicating no functional updates.


## 2:18:17 PM
The log shows a series of edits to instruction files related to UI design and implementation within a Flutter project, likely for a Freshservice mobile application.  The changes primarily involve updating instructions for color and design component mapping, referencing various Figma design files and internal Flutter code.

Between 1:21 PM and 1:23 PM, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/color_mapping.instructions.md` file underwent incremental updates, refining instructions on how to map colors in the UI by referencing specific Dart files within the `/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/theme/colors/` and `/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/theme/typography/` directories.  The final version includes a code snippet example using `context.theme`.

At 1:23:56 PM, the `fs_color_palette.dart` file was updated. This file defines a collection of color constants (Smoke, Elephant, Azure, Jungle, Casablanca, Persimmon, Iris, Milk, Coal, REDLINE, and several derivatives).  A further update at 1:24:13 PM and 1:24:31 PM modified a placeholder within `fs_color_palette.dart`, changing the context usage from `context.theme` to `context.theme.fsTextTheme.b` and finally to `context.theme.fsTextTheme.brand.primary`, indicating a refinement in how theme colors are accessed.


From 1:29 PM to 1:31 PM, and again at 1:36:49 PM, the `color_mapping.instructions.md` file was updated to include a Figma link (https://www.figma.com/design/7CGMvUwJVxM4oIA0ht6AuL/FSDS---Core?node-id=7090-11&m=dev and then updated to https://www.figma.com/design/7CGMvUwJVxM4oIA0ht6AuL/FSDS---Core?node-id=1-11&p=f&t=MCLy2KBOS67jJ8oL-0 ) for color mappings, along with instructions to fetch and explain the Figma design and reference relevant Dart files in the codebase.  A later update simplifies the instruction.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/design_components_mapping.instructions.md` file underwent multiple revisions between 1:32 PM and 1:39 PM. The instructions evolved from referencing a single Figma file related to Typography to include additional Figma links for Specs, Components, and an Audit.  The file consistently points to the `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules for the relevant Flutter code and emphasizes the need for mapping Figma components to their Flutter equivalents. The final version clarifies the instructions and includes examples of mappings.

Between 1:40 PM and 1:53 PM, the `ui_color_mapping.prompt.md` file was modified several times. These changes primarily involved removing  steps related to code generation and streamlining the steps to fetching Figma links, color mapping, and design component mapping.

Finally, a new enum  `FreshserviceComponentsElements` was added in `freshservice_components_elements.dart` file at 1:53:33 PM. This enum seems to list various Freshservice UI components.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/ui/approvals/view/components/delegation_notification.dart` file received several updates between 1:45 PM and 1:47 PM but shows no significant changes in content.  Similarly, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/ui/approvals/view/approvals_screen.dart` file was updated between 1:47 PM and 1:48 PM, these updates do not appear to alter the content.


The overall pattern shows a systematic effort to establish clear guidelines for integrating UI design (from Figma) with the Flutter codebase, focusing on color and component mapping. The repeated edits suggest iterative refinement of the instructions for clarity and completeness.


## 3:18:14 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/design_components_mapping.instructions.md` and several Dart files within the `/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/components` directory.  The primary focus is mapping Figma design components to Flutter UI components.

The `design_components_mapping.instructions.md` file underwent multiple revisions between 2:29 PM and 3:07 PM on May 20, 2025.  Early revisions included links to various sections of a Figma design file (Typography, Specs, Components, Audit). Later revisions consistently focused on the "Specs" and "Components" sections of the Figma design, and eventually only the "Specs" section. The links' `node-id` also changed, indicating a shift in the relevant Figma design sections.  The instructions consistently pointed to the `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules for the Flutter code implementing the mapping.  The list of Flutter UI components being mapped grew over time, starting empty and ultimately including `fs_show_model_bottom_sheet`, various button types (`fs_outline_button`, `fs_plain_button`, `fs_primary_button`, `fs_secondary_button`), `fs_card`, `fs_checkbox`, several chip components (`fs_chip`, `fs_base_chip_group`, `fs_option_chip_group`, `fs_user_chip_group`), `fs_container`, `fs_field_container`, `fs_date_picker`, `fs_alert_dialog`, `fs_empty_item`, and `fs_error_item`.  The final edits simplified the instructions, removing extraneous information and focusing solely on the Figma "Specs" and the complete list of mapped Flutter UI components.


Between 2:35 PM and 2:35 PM, several Dart files were added or modified, each representing a different Flutter UI component:  `fs_date_picker.dart`, `fs_alert_dialog.dart`, `fs_empty_item.dart`, and `fs_error_item.dart`. These files contain the Flutter code for the respective UI elements, and their timestamps show they were added in quick succession, around the same time as the final edits to `design_components_mapping.instructions.md`.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui` directory contains files (`ui_color_mapping.prompt.md` and `ui.prompt.md`)  that reference the instruction file, indicating a workflow where the design component mapping is a prerequisite for subsequent steps, likely involving color mapping within the UI.  These files were modified between 2:36 PM and 3:13 PM.  The final edits removed the note about asking questions for doubts, simplifying the prompt.


## 4:27:37 PM
The log details modifications to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/design_components_mapping.instructions.md`.  The file contains instructions and Figma links for mapping UI components from a Figma design to a Flutter codebase.

Initially, the file contained instructions with Figma links pointing to  `UmPsGEv6o3w6RXHONlecU2/FS-Mobile-Ninja` (with varying node IDs and tokens). Later updates (starting around 3:54:41 PM) switched to links pointing to `GlbBd1CwcHpdVzM72BwOLY/FSDS---Mobile`  (also with varying node IDs and tokens).  These updates involved refining the introductory text to better describe the linked components and their states. Several edits between 3:57 PM and 4:11 PM focused on improving clarity and grammatical correctness of this introductory text, finally settling on a description that specifies that the links are "categorized based on the type of component".

Significant changes occurred around 4:09 PM and continued until 4:27 PM, marking the addition of several Figma links to the `GlbBd1CwcHpdVzM72BwOLY/FSDS---Mobile` design, representing various UI components such as Buttons, Toggle, Radio buttons, Checkboxes, Bottom sheets, Search, Tag & chip, and Input fields.  These edits also added references to the relevant Flutter code located in  `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules, initially with only directory links and then later expanding to list specific Dart files (`fs_show_model_bottom_sheet.dart`, `fs_outline_button.dart`, `fs_plain_button.dart`, `fs_primary_button.dart`, `fs_secondary_button.dart`, `fs_card.dart`, `fs_checkbox.dart`, `fs_chip.dart`, `fs_base_chip_group.dart`, and `fs_option_chip_group.dart`) within those modules. There is a noticeable redundancy in the listing of `fs_show_model_bottom_sheet.dart` in several revisions.  The final version (around 4:27 PM) provides a comprehensive list of Figma links and corresponding Flutter implementations.


## 5:27:34 PM
The log shows a series of edits to a design components mapping instruction file and a UI prompt file between 4:27 PM and 5:22 PM on May 20, 2025.  The key changes revolve around refining instructions for mapping Figma designs to a Flutter codebase.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/design_components_mapping.instructions.md` file underwent several revisions.  Initially, it listed Figma links for various UI components (buttons, toggles, radio buttons, checkboxes, bottom sheets, search bars, tags, and input fields), along with their corresponding Flutter implementations located within `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules.  Subsequent revisions involved minor edits, primarily in the file paths provided to the implemented Flutter UI components— correcting typos and clarifying the directory structure within `/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/components/`. One revision briefly removed some of the listed Figma components and their corresponding Flutter components.  The final version reverted back to a more complete list of components.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui.prompt.md` file was modified more extensively.  Early versions focused on the task of implementing a Figma design (`https://www.figma.com/design/UmPsGEv6o3w6RXHONlecU2/FS-Mobile-Ninja?node-id=27632-10492&t=5zsFNXAwCf9IopYJ-4`), referencing `design_components_mapping.instructions.md` for component mapping.  The instructions gradually evolved to include a color mapping guide (`https://www.figma.com/design/7CGMvUwJVxM4oIA0ht6AuL/FSDS---Core?node-id=7090-11&m=dev`), specific files for color mapping in the Flutter project, and instructions for showcasing the new UI component in a `fs_ui_catalog_app` module via  `showcase_new_screen.instructions.md`.  Finally, the instructions emphasized the use of existing Flutter components (`core_ui` and `common_ui`) and required confirmation before creating new components.  A later revision changed the Figma design link to `https://www.figma.com/design/UmPsGEv6o3w6RXHONlecU2/FS-Mobile-Ninja?node-id=27632-10606&t=xJ0vzD6IGhvjfFRV-4`


The recurring pattern is the iterative refinement of instructions for UI development, emphasizing consistency in Figma-Flutter component and color mapping, and a strong preference for reusing existing code over creating new components.  The timestamps highlight the ongoing nature of the development process and the iterative feedback loop involved.
