# Activity Summary for 5/20/2025

## 11:18:10 AM
On May 20, 2025, at 11:11:09 AM, a documentation file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/color_mapping.instructions.md`, was updated.  This update provides links to Figma design files outlining color mappings and design components used in the Freshservice mobile Flutter application.  The document also lists several Dart files within the `../../../libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/theme` directory that define color palettes, color schemes, and typography for the application, indicating how Figma colors are implemented in the Flutter codebase.  These files include specifications for light and dark themes (`dark_fs_colors.dart`, `light_fs_colors.dart`), constants (`fs_color_constants.dart`, `fs_color_palette.dart`),  schemes (`fs_color_scheme.dart`, `material_color_scheme.dart`), text themes (`fs_text_theme.dart`, `fs_typography.dart`), and dimensions (`dimen.dart`). The update primarily serves as a guide to the color and design system used in the project.


## 12:18:13 PM
The log shows a series of edits primarily focused on updating documentation related to UI design and implementation within a Flutter project.  The updates span approximately 15 minutes on May 20, 2025.

Several files within the `.github/context/ui` directory were repeatedly modified between 12:00 PM and 12:02 PM. These modifications were centered around refining instructions for mapping Figma design components to the Flutter codebase. The final version points to the `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules for UI component references.

The `color_mapping.instructions.md` file (first modified at 11:59 AM) provides links to a Figma design file and lists several Dart files (`fs_color_constants.dart`, `fs_color_palette.dart`, etc.) within the `core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/theme` directory that handle color mappings in the Flutter project.  A later update at 12:16 PM added a note to ask for help if color mapping is problematic.

The `design_components_mapping.instructions.md` file (first updated at 12:00 PM) provides a Figma design link and initially lacked a reference to the relevant code.  Subsequent edits added links and clarified that the mapping is present in `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules.

The `ui_color_mapping.prompt.md` file underwent numerous revisions between 12:03 PM and 12:16 PM. These changes involved clarifying the steps for implementing a Figma design, specifically adding references to both `color_mapping.instructions.md` and `design_components_mapping.instructions.md`  for color and component mapping respectively. The instructions also emphasize using existing components from `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules and creating new ones in the `approval_lib` module if necessary.  The file also had its Figma link updated at 12:15 PM.

Finally, two files, `edit_delegation_screen.dart` and `edit_delegation_component.dart`  show code related to a delegation screen.  `edit_delegation_screen.dart` contains the UI code (updated twice with no functional changes between 12:11 PM and 12:11 PM), and `edit_delegation_component.dart` demonstrates its integration into a UI catalog app (updated once at 12:12 PM).  These files demonstrate the practical application of the design and color system.


## 1:18:13 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Figma design implementation prompt and several updates to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib` Dart library.

The `ui_color_mapping.prompt.md` file was repeatedly updated between 12:19 PM and 12:49 PM with minor edits, primarily clarifying the wording in Step 1 of the prompt instructions. The Figma link in the prompt changed from `node-id=27632-10492` to `node-id=27632-10677` at approximately 12:43 PM, suggesting a switch to a different section of the design.


The `edit_delegation_screen.dart` file underwent significant changes between 12:21 PM and 12:23 PM.  These revisions involved refactoring the styling using a consistent `theme.fsTextTheme`  and `theme.fsColorScheme`, changing the AppBar background color from `.fill.background` to `.fill.surface`, and updating text styles from `headlineMedium` and `bodyLarge` to more specific references like `theme.fsTextTheme.semibold.title` and `theme.fsTextTheme.regular.body`. The background and border colors were also updated to use the new theme scheme.  No functional changes seem present in the logic.

The `approval_lib.dart` file was modified multiple times between 12:34 PM and 12:58 PM. These changes consistently involved adding new exports. Specifically,  `src/ui/approvals_list` files were added, suggesting the addition of a new approvals list feature in the UI. These additions indicate an expansion of the library's functionality to include components related to approval lists, including a new page (`approvals_page.dart`), UI model (`approvals_ui_model.dart`), and UI components (`approval_card.dart` and `delegated_approvals_banner.dart`).

The `localizations_ar.dart` file was unchanged in its two recorded revisions, indicating no functional updates.
