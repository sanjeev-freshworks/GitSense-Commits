# Activity Summary for 5/8/2025

## 11:59:05 AM
The log shows a single code change on May 8th, 2025, at 11:29:12 AM.  This change involved the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/user_lib/lib/src/data/model/feature_type.dart` file.  The file contains a Dart enum `FeatureType` defining two features: `serviceCatalog` and `delegateApprovals`, each with an associated string value.  A static helper method `getFeatureType` is included to retrieve an enum member based on its string value.  The update likely introduces or modifies the definition of supported feature types within the Freshservice mobile application.


## 12:59:05 PM
The log shows two nearly identical entries for the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/user_lib/test/domain/usecase/helper/get_bootstrap_account_expected_result.dart`.  Both entries were made on May 8th, 2025, with a difference of only six seconds between them (12:48:01 PM and 12:48:07 PM).  The code in both entries is the same.  It defines a `GetBootstrapAccountExpectedIO` class containing helper functions to generate expected input/output for a `GetBootstrapAccountUseCase`. This includes generating a `BootstrapAccount` object with sample data for `id`, `fullDomain`, `dateFormat`, `features`, `tempFeatures`, `workSpaceMap`, and `freddyConfigs`. The sample data suggests a test setup for the use case.  The minimal difference in timestamps suggests a possible accidental duplicate entry or a minor, unrecorded change.
