The log shows a single code change on May 8th, 2025, at 11:29:12 AM.  This change involved the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/user_lib/lib/src/data/model/feature_type.dart` file.  The file contains a Dart enum `FeatureType` defining two features: `serviceCatalog` and `delegateApprovals`, each with an associated string value.  A static helper method `getFeatureType` is included to retrieve an enum member based on its string value.  The update likely introduces or modifies the definition of supported feature types within the Freshservice mobile application.
