# Activity Summary for 5/12/2025

## 1:26:34 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_android_freshservice/freshservice_app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file between 12:30 PM and 1:22 PM on May 12, 2025.  The changes primarily involve modifications to the `exported` attribute of several activities and receivers within the application's `<application>` tag.  Specifically, many activities and receivers previously declared as `true` were changed to `false`, indicating a shift towards restricting access to internal components.  There's a pattern of  `<activity>` and `<receiver>` elements grouped by module (Login, Dashboard, NotificationEntity, Ticket, etc.),  suggesting an organized modular architecture.  The `libraries/other-lib` manifests show  permissions related to camera, storage, and audio within their respective library contexts. There were no significant content changes in the other-lib manifests. The main `AndroidManifest.xml` file's structure remained consistent throughout all modifications.  The frequent updates to the main manifest suggest iterative development and adjustments to the app's security and component access.


## 2:26:30 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_android_freshservice/freshservice_app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file between 1:31 PM and 2:05 PM on May 12, 2025.  The changes primarily involve modifications to the `exported` attribute of several `<activity>` and `<service>` elements within the `<application>` tag.  Specifically, numerous activities related to the Ticket, Service Catalog, Task, Approval, and Login modules had their `exported` attribute changed from `true` to `false` in various revisions.  The `exported` attribute for the  `.ui.user.servicecatalog.activity.ServiceCatalogRequestItemActivity` and  `.ui.user.servicecatalog.activity.ServiceCatalogRequestItemHybridWebActivity`, and `.ui.user.task.activity.ModuleTaskListActivity` activities was changed to false in the final revision. The `exported` attribute for the  `.ui.user.task.activity.ModuleTaskListActivity`,  `.ui.user.servicecatalog.activity.ServiceCatalogRequestItemActivity`, and `.ui.user.servicecatalog.activity.ServiceCatalogRequestItemHybridWebActivity` activities were changed from `true` to `false` in the last revision.  The rest of the manifest file remained largely consistent across all revisions.  The changes suggest a refactoring effort to control the accessibility and exposure of certain app components. There are no significant changes detected apart from the `exported` attribute change.


## 4:09:51 PM
The log shows two entries for `/Users/skumar14/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json`, both within a minute of each other on May 12, 2025.  The first entry (3:34:00 PM) includes  settings for various extensions and features, notably CodeGPT settings (API key, autocomplete options), Copilot settings (enabled for various languages and file types), and paths for Python interpreter and Flutter SDK. The second entry (3:34:57 PM) is nearly identical but removes the `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions` array, which was empty in the first entry.  The change appears to be a minor cleanup or unintentional inclusion of an empty array in the first version.  There's no other significant difference between the two versions.  The overall pattern shows configuration of various code editor settings and integrations.
