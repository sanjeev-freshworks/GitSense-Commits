# Activity Summary for 5/12/2025

## 1:26:34 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_android_freshservice/freshservice_app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file between 12:30 PM and 1:22 PM on May 12, 2025.  The changes primarily involve modifications to the `exported` attribute of several activities and receivers within the application's `<application>` tag.  Specifically, many activities and receivers previously declared as `true` were changed to `false`, indicating a shift towards restricting access to internal components.  There's a pattern of  `<activity>` and `<receiver>` elements grouped by module (Login, Dashboard, NotificationEntity, Ticket, etc.),  suggesting an organized modular architecture.  The `libraries/other-lib` manifests show  permissions related to camera, storage, and audio within their respective library contexts. There were no significant content changes in the other-lib manifests. The main `AndroidManifest.xml` file's structure remained consistent throughout all modifications.  The frequent updates to the main manifest suggest iterative development and adjustments to the app's security and component access.


## 2:26:30 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_android_freshservice/freshservice_app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file between 1:31 PM and 2:05 PM on May 12, 2025.  The changes primarily involve modifications to the `exported` attribute of several `<activity>` and `<service>` elements within the `<application>` tag.  Specifically, numerous activities related to the Ticket, Service Catalog, Task, Approval, and Login modules had their `exported` attribute changed from `true` to `false` in various revisions.  The `exported` attribute for the  `.ui.user.servicecatalog.activity.ServiceCatalogRequestItemActivity` and  `.ui.user.servicecatalog.activity.ServiceCatalogRequestItemHybridWebActivity`, and `.ui.user.task.activity.ModuleTaskListActivity` activities was changed to false in the final revision. The `exported` attribute for the  `.ui.user.task.activity.ModuleTaskListActivity`,  `.ui.user.servicecatalog.activity.ServiceCatalogRequestItemActivity`, and `.ui.user.servicecatalog.activity.ServiceCatalogRequestItemHybridWebActivity` activities were changed from `true` to `false` in the last revision.  The rest of the manifest file remained largely consistent across all revisions.  The changes suggest a refactoring effort to control the accessibility and exposure of certain app components. There are no significant changes detected apart from the `exported` attribute change.
