# Activity Summary for 5/12/2025

## 1:26:34 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_android_freshservice/freshservice_app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file between 12:30 PM and 1:22 PM on May 12, 2025.  The changes primarily involve modifications to the `exported` attribute of several activities and receivers within the application's `<application>` tag.  Specifically, many activities and receivers previously declared as `true` were changed to `false`, indicating a shift towards restricting access to internal components.  There's a pattern of  `<activity>` and `<receiver>` elements grouped by module (Login, Dashboard, NotificationEntity, Ticket, etc.),  suggesting an organized modular architecture.  The `libraries/other-lib` manifests show  permissions related to camera, storage, and audio within their respective library contexts. There were no significant content changes in the other-lib manifests. The main `AndroidManifest.xml` file's structure remained consistent throughout all modifications.  The frequent updates to the main manifest suggest iterative development and adjustments to the app's security and component access.
