## 12:08:27 PM
The log shows multiple code changes across several files within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib` directory between 11:10 AM and 11:51 AM on May 9th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the implementation of approval delegation features.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/model/approval_delegate.dart`: This file underwent several updates, all at roughly the same time (between 11:10 AM and 11:12 AM), with no substantive changes to the code itself.  This suggests repeated saves or minor edits without code alterations. The file defines a `ApprovalDelegate` model using freezed,  containing attributes like `id`, `delegateId`, `delegateName`, `delegateEmail`, `delegateAvatarUrl`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `isActive`, `canEdit`, and `canDelete`.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/ui/approvals/di/approvals_lib_ui_module.dart`: Updated twice at 11:51 AM, this file registers UI modules related to approvals, but no changes were visible to the actual code.


In summary, the log demonstrates the comprehensive development and integration of a new approval delegation feature into the Freshservice mobile application.  The repeated saves in several files point to an iterative development process.  The most significant changes occurred in the data source and the UI bloc.
