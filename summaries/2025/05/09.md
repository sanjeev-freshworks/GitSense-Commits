# Activity Summary for 5/9/2025

## 12:08:27 PM
The log shows multiple code changes across several files within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib` directory between 11:10 AM and 11:51 AM on May 9th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the implementation of approval delegation features.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/model/approval_delegate.dart`: This file underwent several updates, all at roughly the same time (between 11:10 AM and 11:12 AM), with no substantive changes to the code itself.  This suggests repeated saves or minor edits without code alterations. The file defines a `ApprovalDelegate` model using freezed,  containing attributes like `id`, `delegateId`, `delegateName`, `delegateEmail`, `delegateAvatarUrl`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `isActive`, `canEdit`, and `canDelete`.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/mapper/approval_delegate_mapper.dart`: This mapper file, also with minimal changes across multiple saves (between 11:12 AM and 11:16 AM),  defines a static method `mapToDomain` to convert an `ApprovalDelegateApiModel` to a `ApprovalDelegate` domain model.  The code remains consistent throughout these updates.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/request/approval_delegate_request.dart`: This file, updated at 11:16 AM, defines the `ApprovalDelegateRequest` model for creating or updating approval delegations, including `delegateId`, `startDate`, and `endDate`.

In summary, the log demonstrates the comprehensive development and integration of a new approval delegation feature into the Freshservice mobile application.  The repeated saves in several files point to an iterative development process.  The most significant changes occurred in the data source and the UI bloc.


## 1:07:55 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the codebase for an approval delegation feature within a Flutter application.  The main files modified are `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/ui/delegations/presentation/model/approval_delegations_state.dart`, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/ui/delegations/presentation/bloc/approval_delegations_bloc.dart`, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/ui/delegations/presentation/mapper/approval_delegation_ui_mapper.dart`, and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/model/approval_delegate.dart`.  There's also a generated file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/model/approval_delegate.g.dart`, which is automatically updated.

`approval_delegations_state.dart` underwent two early revisions (12:24:08 PM and 12:24:23 PM) involving only import statement changes, specifically adding `core_ui` in the second revision.  This suggests refactoring of UI-related dependencies.

`approval_delegations_bloc.dart`  was modified extensively between 12:25:37 PM and 12:58:16 PM.  These changes focused on error handling within the bloc. Initially, the error state only included `code`, `title`, and `description` from `FSErrorUIModel`.  Later revisions removed the `code` field and added an `imageInfo` field, then later removed the `imageInfo` and  `description` fields entirely.  Finally,  the error handling was further improved by introducing a `toFSUIModel` extension method for exception handling, streamlining error representation.  The bloc manages the loading, content, error, and empty states for approval delegations, implementing functions for loading, refreshing, creating, updating, and deleting delegations.

`approval_delegation_ui_mapper.dart` had minor revisions (12:26:25 PM and 12:27:38 PM),  primarily modifying date formatting. The changes uniformly switched date formatting from `MMM_dd_yyyy` to `FSDateFormat.mediumDate`.  This indicates a consistent change in date display preference across the codebase.

`approval_delegate.dart` experienced two nearly identical revisions (12:27:43 PM and 12:28:59 PM) with no functional changes; this was likely an accidental double save.  The file defines the data model for an approval delegate using Freezed and JsonSerializable annotations, indicating the model is designed for both internal representation and JSON serialization.

The generated file `approval_delegate.g.dart` was updated at 12:34:06 PM, reflecting changes in the `approval_delegate.dart` file, specifically how date information is handled in JSON serialization.


The overall pattern suggests an iterative development process focusing on refining error handling in the `ApprovalDelegationsBloc`,  improving date formatting consistency in the UI, and ensuring robust data handling through Freezed and JsonSerializable.  The numerous revisions to `approval_delegations_bloc.dart` towards the end show a concentrated effort on improving error handling and localization.
