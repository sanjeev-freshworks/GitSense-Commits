# Activity Summary for 5/22/2025

## 8:11:37 AM
The log shows a series of code changes within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, specifically focusing on the `approval_lib` library.  The changes span from 7:56 AM to 8:07 AM on May 22, 2025.

The initial change (7:56 AM) to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/delegate_approval_post_request.prompt.md` is a prompt file detailing the generation of Dart code for handling approval delegation requests and responses. It specifies using a code generation tool (`data_layer_codegen`), API information from several source files, request body structure, and naming conventions for generated files (e.g., `approval_remote_constants.dart`, `approval_remote_data_source.dart`, `approvals_repository.dart`).

Subsequent changes (7:58 AM - 8:01 AM) involve the creation and modification of Dart files within the `approval_lib` library:

* `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/approval_remote_constants.dart`: This file defines constants related to API endpoints and query parameters for various approval-related operations.  A large number of API endpoints are added, suggesting comprehensive functionality related to approvals, CABs (Change Advisory Boards), and groups.

* `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/delegation_api_model.dart`: This file defines a Dart model for the API response related to approval delegation.

* `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/delegation_response_model_mapper.dart`: This file contains a mapper to transform the API response model into a data model.

* `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/approval_remote_data_source.dart`: This file implements the remote data source for the approval library, containing numerous functions for interacting with the API, including methods for fetching approval lists, resending, canceling approvals, managing approval groups, updating approval chains, and retrieving CAB information, approval templates, and service owners.  Multiple calls to `get`, `post`, and `put` HTTP methods are observed. This file underwent multiple revisions within a short timeframe (8:00:17 AM, 8:00:27 AM, 8:00:36 AM), indicating iterative development and refinement.

* `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/repository/approvals_repository.dart`: Defines the interface for the approvals repository, outlining numerous methods for interacting with approval data.

* `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/repository/impl/approvals_repository_impl.dart`: Provides an implementation of the approvals repository, delegating most of the work to the `ApprovalRemoteDataSource` and using `ApprovalLocalDataSource` for local storage. The file also underwent multiple revisions (8:01:06 AM, 8:01:23 AM), indicating further development and refinement.


* `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/approval_lib.dart`: This is the library file which exports various modules within the approval library. There were multiple revisions (8:01:28 AM, 8:02:29 AM, 8:05:20 AM, 8:06:27 AM, 8:07:30 AM, 8:07:49 AM), likely reflecting refinements to the exported components. Notably, the 8:07:30 AM revision includes a `hide Delegatee` statement, suggesting a potential restructuring or refactoring of the `module_approval.dart` file.

The overall pattern shows the development of a comprehensive library for handling approvals, including remote data access, data mapping, and repository implementation.  The repeated revisions of  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/approval_remote_data_source.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/repository/impl/approvals_repository_impl.dart` suggest a focus on perfecting the API interaction and data handling within the library. The multiple exports in `approval_lib.dart` indicate modular design for better maintainability and reusability.


## 9:11:46 AM
The log shows a series of code changes related to an approval library (`approval_lib`) within a Flutter mobile application (Freshservice).  The primary focus is on the implementation of API calls for managing approval delegations, including creation, update, and retrieval.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/delegate_approval_post_request.prompt.md` file underwent multiple revisions between 8:12 AM and 8:33 AM, primarily adjusting the description of the intended API interaction.  Early versions focused on "Create Approval Delegation," while later versions shifted to "Get Approval Delegation" and "Get Delegation Detail."  The request body remained consistent throughout these changes.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/approval_remote_constants.dart` file was updated several times (8:13 AM - 8:13 AM, 8:34 AM, 8:55 AM, and 9:02 AM).  These changes added and modified API endpoint paths for various approval-related operations. Specifically, `agentDelegationDetail` and `requesterDelegationDetail` were added at 8:16 AM to handle agent and requester delegation details. Later updates (8:34 AM and onwards) included paths for `updateApprovalDelegationAgentPath`, `updateApprovalDelegationRequesterPath`, and `getApprovalDelegationAgentPath`, `getApprovalDelegationRequesterPath` for updating and retrieving delegation details.


A new file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/model/request/create_approval_delegation_request.dart` was added at 8:35 AM, defining a model for the request body of the API call to create/update a delegation.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/approval_remote_data_source.dart` file was significantly altered between 8:18 AM and 9:04 AM.  These changes introduced functions for various API interactions related to approvals, reflecting the actions described in the `.prompt.md` file.  Specifically, functions for creating and updating approval delegations were added.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/repository/approvals_repository.dart` file (updated at 8:18 AM, 8:37 AM, and 9:04 AM) evolved to include methods for the new delegation API calls (create, update, get).

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/repository/impl/approvals_repository_impl.dart` file (updated at 8:19 AM and 8:37 AM) added the implementation of the new repository methods, delegating to the `ApprovalRemoteDataSource`.

Mapper files, such as `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/delegation_api_model_mapper.dart` (updated at 9:00 AM) and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/delegation_detail_api_model_mapper.dart` (updated at 9:00 AM), were also updated to handle the mapping between API response models and data models.

Finally, a test file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/test/ui/approval_group_detail/presentation/helper/mapper/approval_group_ui_mapper_test.mocks.dart` (updated at 8:24 AM), suggests ongoing testing and development related to the approval feature.  The presence of mock objects indicates a test environment setup.

In summary, the code changes reflect a focused effort to implement and test API functionality for managing approval delegations within the Freshservice mobile app.  The iterative nature of the `.prompt.md` file demonstrates refinement in the API interaction specifications, while the numerous updates to the `approval_remote_data_source.dart` and related files highlight comprehensive implementation of these new features.
