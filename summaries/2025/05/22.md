Notably, the 8:07:30 AM revision includes a `hide Delegatee` statement, suggesting a potential restructuring or refactoring of the `module_approval.dart` file.

The overall pattern shows the development of a comprehensive library for handling approvals, including remote data access, data mapping, and repository implementation.  The repeated revisions of  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/approval_remote_data_source.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/repository/impl/approvals_repository_impl.dart` suggest a focus on perfecting the API interaction and data handling within the library. The multiple exports in `approval_lib.dart` indicate modular design for better maintainability and reusability.


## 9:11:46 AM
The log shows a series of code changes related to an approval library (`approval_lib`) within a Flutter mobile application (Freshservice).  The primary focus is on the implementation of API calls for managing approval delegations, including creation, update, and retrieval.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/delegate_approval_post_request.prompt.md` file underwent multiple revisions between 8:12 AM and 8:33 AM, primarily adjusting the description of the intended API interaction.  Early versions focused on "Create Approval Delegation," while later versions shifted to "Get Approval Delegation" and "Get Delegation Detail."  The request body remained consistent throughout these changes.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/approval_remote_constants.dart` file was updated several times (8:13 AM - 8:13 AM, 8:34 AM, 8:55 AM, and 9:02 AM).  These changes added and modified API endpoint paths for various approval-related operations. Specifically, `agentDelegationDetail` and `requesterDelegationDetail` were added at 8:16 AM to handle agent and requester delegation details. Later updates (8:34 AM and onwards) included paths for `updateApprovalDelegationAgentPath`, `updateApprovalDelegationRequesterPath`, and `getApprovalDelegationAgentPath`, `getApprovalDelegationRequesterPath` for updating and retrieving delegation details.


A new file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/model/request/create_approval_delegation_request.dart` was added at 8:35 AM, defining a model for the request body of the API call to create/update a delegation.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/approval_remote_data_source.dart` file was significantly altered between 8:18 AM and 9:04 AM.  These changes introduced functions for various API interactions related to approvals, reflecting the actions described in the `.prompt.md` file.  Specifically, functions for creating and updating approval delegations were added.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/repository/approvals_repository.dart` file (updated at 8:18 AM, 8:37 AM, and 9:04 AM) evolved to include methods for the new delegation API calls (create, update, get).

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/repository/impl/approvals_repository_impl.dart` file (updated at 8:19 AM and 8:37 AM) added the implementation of the new repository methods, delegating to the `ApprovalRemoteDataSource`.

Mapper files, such as `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/delegation_api_model_mapper.dart` (updated at 9:00 AM) and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/delegation_detail_api_model_mapper.dart` (updated at 9:00 AM), were also updated to handle the mapping between API response models and data models.

Finally, a test file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/test/ui/approval_group_detail/presentation/helper/mapper/approval_group_ui_mapper_test.mocks.dart` (updated at 8:24 AM), suggests ongoing testing and development related to the approval feature.  The presence of mock objects indicates a test environment setup.

In summary, the code changes reflect a focused effort to implement and test API functionality for managing approval delegations within the Freshservice mobile app.  The iterative nature of the `.prompt.md` file demonstrates refinement in the API interaction specifications, while the numerous updates to the `approval_remote_data_source.dart` and related files highlight comprehensive implementation of these new features.


## 10:11:38 AM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib` directory, specifically within the `approval_delegate/view` subdirectory.  The changes center around a Flutter BLoC (Business Logic Component) for managing the UI of an approval delegate screen.

The initial changes (between 9:12:05 AM and 9:13:34 AM) involved refining the `view_approval_delegate_bloc.dart` file. This included restructuring event handling, adding error handling for use cases (`GetApprovalDelegateUseCase` and `DeleteApprovalDelegateUseCase`), and updating how success and failure messages are handled using `UCResult` and  `UserMessage`.  There are multiple revisions to this file within a short time span, suggesting iterative development and debugging.

Between 9:12:51 AM and 9:12:59 AM,  the `delete_approval_delegate_use_case.dart` and `get_approval_delegate_use_case.dart` files were updated, likely to align with the `UCResult` based error handling in the BLoC.

A significant change occurred at 9:50:29 AM and 9:50:44 AM.  The `view_approval_delegate_bloc.dart` was heavily revised.  The event handling was changed to use a `map` function instead of `when`,  and the use cases were renamed to `GetApprovalDelegationUseCase` and `DeleteApprovalDelegationUseCase`, indicating a potential renaming of the underlying data structures or repositories. The bloc was also updated to use constructor injection.  The error handling was further improved by leveraging `result.hasError`  and `result.map` functionality of the `UCResult` object.

At 9:51:35 AM and 9:53:31 AM, the dependency injection module (`approval_delegate_view_ui_module.dart`) was updated to reflect the changes in the BLoC.

Subsequently, the unit test file (`view_approval_delegate_bloc_test.dart`) underwent several revisions (between 9:54:49 AM and 10:04:37 AM) to match the updated BLoC, adding more robust testing for different scenarios and error handling. The use of `bloc_test` and Mockito showcases thorough testing practices.  There were several minor revisions to this file in a short timeframe, showing debugging and refinement. Finally, around 10:06 AM, several prompts relating to code generation using a generic presentation layer BLoC template were logged.  This further points to a structured, automated approach to BLoC generation.  The prompts were modified iteratively to correct the file paths in the prompt parameters.


## 11:11:34 AM
The log shows a series of code changes to the `view_approval_delegate_bloc.dart` file and its corresponding test file, `view_approval_delegate_bloc_test.dart`.  The modifications primarily focus on improving the Bloc's event handling and error management.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/ui/approval_delegate/view/presentation/bloc/view_approval_delegate_bloc.dart`**

The `view_approval_delegate_bloc.dart` file underwent multiple revisions between 10:13 AM and 10:29 AM on May 22, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent—handling loading approval delegation details, navigating to the edit screen, and deleting the delegation.  However, the changes focused on refactoring the event handling:

* **Initial Version (10:13 AM):**  Used individual `on` methods for each event.
* **Second Revision (10:15 AM):** Introduced a single `on<ViewApprovalDelegateUIEvent>` method with a `when` statement for cleaner event handling.  Improved error handling in `_onViewCreated` by using `delegationResult.when` for handling success and error cases from the use case.  The `UserMessage` type was changed from `error` to `string` in `_onTurnOffDelegateClicked`.
* **Third Revision (10:23 AM - 10:29 AM):** Further refined event handling by making all event handlers asynchronous using `async`/`await` and passing `Emitter` directly into event handler functions. Added checks (`!emit.isDone`) to ensure that state updates happen only if the emit operation is not already complete.  This likely improves the reliability of state updates within the Bloc.


**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/test/ui/approval_delegate/view/presentation/bloc/view_approval_delegate_bloc_test.dart`**

The test file, `view_approval_delegate_bloc_test.dart`, was updated alongside the BLoC file to reflect the changes in event handling and state transitions.  The major updates in the test file are:

* **Initial Version (10:19 AM):**  Basic unit tests were added for various Bloc events.
* **Subsequent Revisions (10:21 AM - 10:29 AM):**  The test cases were adjusted to match the changes in the Bloc's structure and the handling of states.  The `skip` parameter was added in one test then removed in favor of a `wait` parameter to ensure the test waits for the state to be updated correctly.  The assertions regarding the `userMessage` type was also corrected.

The overall pattern across changes indicates a consistent effort towards improving the code's readability, maintainability, and robustness, specifically concerning error handling and event management within the Flutter Bloc architecture.


## 12:11:28 PM
The log shows modifications to two files between 12:05 PM and 12:06 PM on May 22, 2025.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/l10n/generated/localizations_de.dart` received a single update at 12:05:28 PM. This update appears to be related to German language localization for a Flutter application, adding a class `FSUICatalogLocalizationsDe` that likely handles German translations.  The code includes an unexplained `slkfj;`.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/components/container/fs_field_container.dart` underwent multiple revisions between 12:05:39 PM and 12:06:29 PM.  The file defines a `FSFieldContainer` widget in Flutter. This widget is a container for form fields, dynamically adjusting its background and border color based on whether the field is enabled (`enabled`) or contains an error (`isError`).  The changes in this file seem to primarily involve removing extra code; specifically, a  `x,` parameter and the line `hello;` were added and subsequently removed. The core functionality of the `FSFieldContainer` widget remained consistent throughout the revisions.


## 1:11:29 PM
The log shows a series of code changes between 12:56 PM and 12:57 PM on May 22, 2025,  focused on generating data layer code for handling approval delegations in a Freshservice mobile application.  The changes primarily involve updating prompts for a `data_layer_codegen` tool.

The prompts consistently target the `approval_lib` module and use API information sourced from  `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/delegate_approval/delegate_approval.md` and `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/support_portal/delegate_approval/delegate_approval.md`  (with variations in the specific paths used across different prompts).  Additional JSON response files from the same `freshservice_mobile_api_mock` directory are used for POST and PUT requests.


Specific updates include:

* **`delegate_approval_delete_request.prompt.md`**: This file was updated multiple times.  The initial versions used a single `api_info` source. Later versions differentiate between agent and requester API information.

* **`delegate_approval_post_request.prompt.md`**:  This file was also updated once. The initial version used a single `api_info` source plus response examples, while later versions differentiated  between agent and requester API information.

* **`delegate_approval_put_request.prompt.md`**: This file was added, specifying the update of approval delegations and reusing models from the POST request.


All prompts specify the same output files: `approval_remote_constants.dart`, `approval_remote_data_source.dart`, `approvals_repository.dart`, and `approvals_repository_impl.dart`,  and mapper files in `mapper/request` and `mapper/response` folders. The consistent structure across all prompts suggests a systematic approach to code generation for different API endpoints (DELETE, POST, PUT) related to approval delegation.  The timestamps indicate a rapid succession of changes, potentially refining the prompts for more accurate code generation.


## 3:11:47 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on UI generation from Figma JSON data and mapping UI components to a `core_ui` module.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/settings.json` file was updated twice within a minute (1:16:27 PM and 1:16:37 PM), with only a minor syntax correction in the `chat.promptFilesLocations` object—a comma was added for proper JSON formatting.  This file defines a task plan and lists tasks related to data modeling, API creation, repository generation, and use case development.

Several updates occurred to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/temp_prompts/ui_gen.prompt.md` file between 1:16:55 PM and 1:31:00 PM. These changes progressively refined a prompt for a large language model (LLM). The prompt initially requested a detailed description of Figma JSON data.  It was later modified to request a mapping of UI components and their children from the JSON data to the `core_ui` module, with multiple revisions correcting the file path to the `core_ui` directory. The final version of the prompt (1:31:00 PM) is well-defined and includes instructions to map UI components and their children with components in the `core_ui` module, clearly specifying the location of that module.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/temp_prompts/figma_json.json` file underwent multiple revisions between 1:17:13 PM and 1:26:09 PM. The JSON data appears to represent Figma design data for a "Toggle" UI element, including detailed information on its children, fills, strokes, and Tailwind CSS styling.  The content of the file remained largely consistent throughout these edits, suggesting minor adjustments or version control operations.

A new Figma JSON file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/temp_prompts/button_figma.json`, appeared at 1:37:59 PM, containing detailed Figma design data for a "Button" UI element, similar in structure to the `figma_json.json` file. The data includes various button states (primary, secondary, outline, plain) and variants (with/without icon, full width), along with their specifications.

Another new Figma JSON file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/temp_prompts/toggle_figma.json`, was added at 1:43:28 PM, containing detailed Figma data for a toggle element.  Similarly structured JSON files (`radio_figma.json`, `checkbox_figma.json`, `bottomsheet_figma.json`, `search_figma.json`, `tag_chip_figma.json`, and `input_field_figma.json`) were added for other UI elements.

Finally, a  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/temp_prompts/colors_figma.json` file was created (1:51:38 PM and updated at 1:54:41 PM) containing Figma data related to design tokens, including colors for text, icons, fills, overlays, and boundaries, organized in a structured way.

The `ui_gen.prompt.md` file was updated multiple times to reflect the addition of these new JSON files, culminating in a prompt (2:28:24 PM and later) that includes data from all the Figma JSON files, requesting a comprehensive mapping of UI components and colors to a `core_ui` module. The prompt also includes fetching a Figma link using a specific server and describing the screen, then identifying which `core_ui` components are used.  The final prompts emphasize detail and specify the desired output format and context (`context.theme.fsColorScheme.primary`). The repeated edits to the prompts show an iterative refinement of the request to the LLM.  A pattern emerges of progressively incorporating more Figma data and clarifying the required mapping.
