# Activity Summary for 4/2/2025

## 1:21:10 PM
The log shows a series of merge commits between  `4/2/2025, 12:24:45 PM` and `4/2/2025, 12:25:05 PM` from the `feature/parallel_approval_translation` branch into `merge/update_freddy_response_suggester_with_parallel_approval_translation`.  The primary changes involve extensive modifications to string resources (`strings.xml`) across numerous language locales within the `features/on-call` and `freshservice_app` modules. This suggests a localization update.  Additionally, many files were modified in the  `features/support-portal`, `features/ticket`, `freshservice_app`, and various libraries (`libraries/fs-lib`, `libraries/other-lib`). These changes span data sources, repositories, use cases, presenters, views, and adapters. Several new files were added, mainly in `freshservice_app` and `libraries/fs-lib/common-ui`, indicating new features or UI components related to notifications and attachments.  The `gradle/libs.versions.toml` file was repeatedly modified, likely reflecting version updates during the merge process, particularly updates to the flutter module (versions 1.0.5-alpha and 1.0.5-alpha.4 are mentioned). A file (`build-logic/src/main/kotlin/freshservice/buildlogic/helper/constants/FSAppConstants.kt`) was deleted.  The consistent pattern of modifications across multiple layers (data, domain, presentation, UI) suggests a comprehensive update impacting various aspects of the application.
