# Activity Summary for 4/2/2025

## 1:21:10 PM
The log shows a series of merge commits between  `4/2/2025, 12:24:45 PM` and `4/2/2025, 12:25:05 PM` from the `feature/parallel_approval_translation` branch into `merge/update_freddy_response_suggester_with_parallel_approval_translation`.  The primary changes involve extensive modifications to string resources (`strings.xml`) across numerous language locales within the `features/on-call` and `freshservice_app` modules. This suggests a localization update.  Additionally, many files were modified in the  `features/support-portal`, `features/ticket`, `freshservice_app`, and various libraries (`libraries/fs-lib`, `libraries/other-lib`). These changes span data sources, repositories, use cases, presenters, views, and adapters. Several new files were added, mainly in `freshservice_app` and `libraries/fs-lib/common-ui`, indicating new features or UI components related to notifications and attachments.  The `gradle/libs.versions.toml` file was repeatedly modified, likely reflecting version updates during the merge process, particularly updates to the flutter module (versions 1.0.5-alpha and 1.0.5-alpha.4 are mentioned). A file (`build-logic/src/main/kotlin/freshservice/buildlogic/helper/constants/FSAppConstants.kt`) was deleted.  The consistent pattern of modifications across multiple layers (data, domain, presentation, UI) suggests a comprehensive update impacting various aspects of the application.


## 5:21:11 PM
The log shows iterative development of a mitmproxy script (`freshservice_mitm.py`) between 4:52 PM and 5:20 PM on April 2nd, 2025.  The script intercepts and modifies HTTP responses from a Freshservice API endpoint.

Initially, the script only contained a `response` function that logged intercepted responses.  Subsequent changes focused on refining the data manipulation within the `changeAdditionalItems` function.  There was experimentation with accessing nested JSON data (using incorrect indexing initially), culminating in correctly extracting and modifying the "name" field within the "service_items" array.  Between 4:57 PM and 5:05 PM, the focus shifted to correctly accessing the 'name' field within the nested JSON structure.  The logging statements were initially removed and later re-added using f-strings for improved formatting.

Around 5:10 PM, the script started modifying the intercepted response by changing the "name" field to "Sanjeev Kumar" and sending the modified JSON back.  A second function, `updateAdditionalItems`, was added around 5:13 PM, initially mirroring the functionality of `changeAdditionalItems`.  This function was later modified to update the "total_pages" and "total_items" fields in the "meta" section of the JSON response.  The values were set to 2 and 6, respectively.

Finally, between 5:17 PM and 5:20 PM, a `request` function was added.  This function intercepts requests to the same Freshservice API endpoint and modifies the "page" query parameter to 5 before the request is sent to the server.  The `updateAdditionalItems` function in the `request` section modifies the response before it's even sent by the server.  The final version of the script modifies both requests and responses to the specified Freshservice API endpoint.  The "siderfighter" comment consistently appears throughout the code, suggesting a potential identifier or project name.


## 7:37:29 PM
The log shows iterative development of a mitmproxy script (`freshservice_mitm.py`) designed to intercept and modify Freshservice API requests and responses.  The script focuses on the endpoint `/api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items`.

The earliest modifications (between 5:22:04 PM and 5:22:25 PM) involved manipulating the request's `page` query parameter; changing it to `5` if it is `2`.  A subsequent change (5:22:25 PM) added the `updateAdditionalItems` function call in the `response` section.

Between 5:27:36 PM and 5:38:26 PM, the focus shifted to modifying the response.  Initially, attempts were made to double the `service_items` list through multiplication (`*= 2`) and addition (`+=`). These attempts were flawed due to the direct modification of the list (causing unintended changes during the iteration).  The final version (5:38:26 PM) successfully doubles the `service_items` list by creating a copy before manipulation.  Additionally, a counter (`i`) is used to increment the `display_id` of each `service_item` in the appended list, ensuring unique IDs after duplication.  The commented-out lines  `# data["meta"]["total_pages"] = 2` and `# data["meta"]["total_items"] = 6` suggest initial attempts to update metadata related to the total pages and items, which were later abandoned.  The name of the first service item is consistently changed to "Sanjeev Kumar".

Throughout the development process, logging statements using `ctx.log.warn` were added and modified to track the changes to `flow.request.query` and `serviceItems` length.  The overall pattern suggests a debugging process focusing on correctly manipulating the response's JSON data to duplicate the service items and update their display IDs.
