# Activity Summary for 4/7/2025

## 8:17:17 AM
The script `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, last modified on 4/7/2025, 7:52:11 AM, is a Mitmproxy script designed to intercept and modify Freshservice API requests and responses.

The script's `InterceptFreshservice` class contains three main methods: `websocket_message`, `request`, and `response`.

The `websocket_message` method intercepts websocket messages, specifically targeting messages containing a "msg" key in the JSON payload. If found, it manipulates the message to inject an error response indicating "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS".

The `request` method focuses on modifying requests to the URL containing  "api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items".  Specifically, if the `page` query parameter is 2, it changes it to 5.

The `response` method contains multiple functions (`changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, `changeResponseDirectly`) all operating on responses from the same URL ("api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items").  `changeAdditionalItems` alters the name of the first service item to "Sanjeev Kumar".  `updateAdditionalItems` duplicates the `service_items` array, appending the duplicated items to the original and incrementing the `display_id` of each item. `changeResponseDirectly` completely replaces the response body with a simple JSON object `{"hello": "hi"}`.  The script currently calls only `changeResponseDirectly` leaving the other two commented out.

The script uses extensive logging (`ctx.log.warn`) for debugging purposes.  The consistent target URL ("api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items") suggests a focus on manipulating specific data within Freshservice's service item catalog.  The manipulation techniques range from simple query parameter changes to complex data structure modifications and complete response overwrites.


## 9:17:17 AM
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py` file over a short period (approximately 10 minutes) on April 7, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is manipulating responses from a Freshservice API, particularly those related to service items (with ID 18) and reply suggestions.

The `websocket_message` function consistently modifies websocket messages to return a "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS" error. This remains unchanged throughout the log.

The `response` function undergoes several iterations.  Initially, it contains multiple functions (`changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, `changeResponseDirectly`), some of which are commented out at various stages.  `changeAdditionalItems` modifies the name of a service item in the response. `updateAdditionalItems` duplicates the `service_items` array and increments the `display_id` of each item. `changeResponseDirectly` replaces the entire response with a test JSON string.

A significant change occurs around 8:52 AM when a new function, `changeFreddyReplySuggestion`, is introduced to handle requests to the "/reply-suggestion" URL.  This function initially attempts to modify the `status_code`, then evolves to modify the response body to set a `"success"` flag to `False`.  The final version correctly uses `json.dumps` to set the modified response.

The series of edits suggests iterative development and debugging of the response manipulation logic, with the developer experimenting with different approaches and refining the code to achieve the desired outcome of modifying Freshservice API responses.  The final version of the code appears to have a complete and functional set of responses for both websocket and HTTP requests.
