# Activity Summary for 4/7/2025

## 8:17:17 AM
The script `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, last modified on 4/7/2025, 7:52:11 AM, is a Mitmproxy script designed to intercept and modify Freshservice API requests and responses.

The script's `InterceptFreshservice` class contains three main methods: `websocket_message`, `request`, and `response`.

The `websocket_message` method intercepts websocket messages, specifically targeting messages containing a "msg" key in the JSON payload. If found, it manipulates the message to inject an error response indicating "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS".

The `request` method focuses on modifying requests to the URL containing  "api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items".  Specifically, if the `page` query parameter is 2, it changes it to 5.

The `response` method contains multiple functions (`changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, `changeResponseDirectly`) all operating on responses from the same URL ("api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items").  `changeAdditionalItems` alters the name of the first service item to "Sanjeev Kumar".  `updateAdditionalItems` duplicates the `service_items` array, appending the duplicated items to the original and incrementing the `display_id` of each item. `changeResponseDirectly` completely replaces the response body with a simple JSON object `{"hello": "hi"}`.  The script currently calls only `changeResponseDirectly` leaving the other two commented out.

The script uses extensive logging (`ctx.log.warn`) for debugging purposes.  The consistent target URL ("api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items") suggests a focus on manipulating specific data within Freshservice's service item catalog.  The manipulation techniques range from simple query parameter changes to complex data structure modifications and complete response overwrites.


## 9:17:17 AM
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py` file over a short period (approximately 10 minutes) on April 7, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is manipulating responses from a Freshservice API, particularly those related to service items (with ID 18) and reply suggestions.

The `websocket_message` function consistently modifies websocket messages to return a "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS" error. This remains unchanged throughout the log.

The `response` function undergoes several iterations.  Initially, it contains multiple functions (`changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, `changeResponseDirectly`), some of which are commented out at various stages.  `changeAdditionalItems` modifies the name of a service item in the response. `updateAdditionalItems` duplicates the `service_items` array and increments the `display_id` of each item. `changeResponseDirectly` replaces the entire response with a test JSON string.

A significant change occurs around 8:52 AM when a new function, `changeFreddyReplySuggestion`, is introduced to handle requests to the "/reply-suggestion" URL.  This function initially attempts to modify the `status_code`, then evolves to modify the response body to set a `"success"` flag to `False`.  The final version correctly uses `json.dumps` to set the modified response.

The series of edits suggests iterative development and debugging of the response manipulation logic, with the developer experimenting with different approaches and refining the code to achieve the desired outcome of modifying Freshservice API responses.  The final version of the code appears to have a complete and functional set of responses for both websocket and HTTP requests.


## 10:17:18 AM
The log shows modifications to `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`.  The file is a Python script that appears to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses, likely for testing or debugging a Freshservice integration.

The primary focus of the changes revolves around modifying responses:

* **Websocket Message Manipulation (9:51 AM onwards):**  A `websocket_message` function intercepts websocket messages and alters the JSON content of the `msg` field to simulate a "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS" error.  The error message was later changed to "NO_RESPONSE_FOUND" at 10:01:35 AM.  This suggests testing scenarios involving rate limiting or API failures.

* **Response Modification (9:51 AM onwards):** Several functions (`changeFreddyReplySuggestion`, `changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, `changeResponseDirectly`) modify HTTP responses.  `changeAdditionalItems` consistently changes the name of a service item within a response. `updateAdditionalItems` duplicates service items and modifies their display IDs. `changeFreddyReplySuggestion` initially modifies a success field in a response but is later simplified to only change the status code to 404.  `changeResponseDirectly` replaces the entire response body with a test string. This indicates comprehensive testing of various response handling within the system.

* **Request Parameter Modification (9:51 AM onwards):** An `updateAdditionalItems` function within the `request` method changes the page number in a query parameter from 2 to 5. This may be intended to test pagination functionality.


The changes between 9:51 AM and 9:59 AM mainly involve commenting out or uncommenting specific functions, suggesting experimentation with different response manipulation strategies. The most significant change is the update of the error message within the websocket manipulation at 10:01:35 AM.  The overall pattern shows iterative debugging and testing of various response handling scenarios.
