# Activity Summary for 4/7/2025

## 8:17:17 AM
The script `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, last modified on 4/7/2025, 7:52:11 AM, is a Mitmproxy script designed to intercept and modify Freshservice API requests and responses.

The script's `InterceptFreshservice` class contains three main methods: `websocket_message`, `request`, and `response`.

The `websocket_message` method intercepts websocket messages, specifically targeting messages containing a "msg" key in the JSON payload. If found, it manipulates the message to inject an error response indicating "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS".

The `request` method focuses on modifying requests to the URL containing  "api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items".  Specifically, if the `page` query parameter is 2, it changes it to 5.

The `response` method contains multiple functions (`changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, `changeResponseDirectly`) all operating on responses from the same URL ("api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items").  `changeAdditionalItems` alters the name of the first service item to "Sanjeev Kumar".  `updateAdditionalItems` duplicates the `service_items` array, appending the duplicated items to the original and incrementing the `display_id` of each item. `changeResponseDirectly` completely replaces the response body with a simple JSON object `{"hello": "hi"}`.  The script currently calls only `changeResponseDirectly` leaving the other two commented out.

The script uses extensive logging (`ctx.log.warn`) for debugging purposes.  The consistent target URL ("api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items") suggests a focus on manipulating specific data within Freshservice's service item catalog.  The manipulation techniques range from simple query parameter changes to complex data structure modifications and complete response overwrites.


## 9:17:17 AM
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py` file over a short period (approximately 10 minutes) on April 7, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is manipulating responses from a Freshservice API, particularly those related to service items (with ID 18) and reply suggestions.

The `websocket_message` function consistently modifies websocket messages to return a "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS" error. This remains unchanged throughout the log.

The `response` function undergoes several iterations.  Initially, it contains multiple functions (`changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, `changeResponseDirectly`), some of which are commented out at various stages.  `changeAdditionalItems` modifies the name of a service item in the response. `updateAdditionalItems` duplicates the `service_items` array and increments the `display_id` of each item. `changeResponseDirectly` replaces the entire response with a test JSON string.

A significant change occurs around 8:52 AM when a new function, `changeFreddyReplySuggestion`, is introduced to handle requests to the "/reply-suggestion" URL.  This function initially attempts to modify the `status_code`, then evolves to modify the response body to set a `"success"` flag to `False`.  The final version correctly uses `json.dumps` to set the modified response.

The series of edits suggests iterative development and debugging of the response manipulation logic, with the developer experimenting with different approaches and refining the code to achieve the desired outcome of modifying Freshservice API responses.  The final version of the code appears to have a complete and functional set of responses for both websocket and HTTP requests.


## 10:17:18 AM
The log shows modifications to `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`.  The file is a Python script that appears to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses, likely for testing or debugging a Freshservice integration.

The primary focus of the changes revolves around modifying responses:

* **Websocket Message Manipulation (9:51 AM onwards):**  A `websocket_message` function intercepts websocket messages and alters the JSON content of the `msg` field to simulate a "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS" error.  The error message was later changed to "NO_RESPONSE_FOUND" at 10:01:35 AM.  This suggests testing scenarios involving rate limiting or API failures.

* **Response Modification (9:51 AM onwards):** Several functions (`changeFreddyReplySuggestion`, `changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, `changeResponseDirectly`) modify HTTP responses.  `changeAdditionalItems` consistently changes the name of a service item within a response. `updateAdditionalItems` duplicates service items and modifies their display IDs. `changeFreddyReplySuggestion` initially modifies a success field in a response but is later simplified to only change the status code to 404.  `changeResponseDirectly` replaces the entire response body with a test string. This indicates comprehensive testing of various response handling within the system.

* **Request Parameter Modification (9:51 AM onwards):** An `updateAdditionalItems` function within the `request` method changes the page number in a query parameter from 2 to 5. This may be intended to test pagination functionality.


The changes between 9:51 AM and 9:59 AM mainly involve commenting out or uncommenting specific functions, suggesting experimentation with different response manipulation strategies. The most significant change is the update of the error message within the websocket manipulation at 10:01:35 AM.  The overall pattern shows iterative debugging and testing of various response handling scenarios.


## 11:17:18 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Python script (`freshservice_mitm.py`) designed to intercept and modify HTTP requests and WebSocket messages, likely for testing or modifying a Freshservice instance.  The primary focus is manipulating responses related to service items (ID 18) and reply suggestions.

The earliest changes (around 10:21 AM) involved the creation of the script, including functions to modify WebSocket messages to return a "NO_RESPONSE_FOUND" error and to alter HTTP requests' query parameters ("page" from 2 to 5).  The script also includes functions to intercept responses for specific URLs:

* `/reply-suggestion`: This URL's response is changed to a 404 status code.
* `"api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items"`: This URL is repeatedly targeted.  Various modifications are attempted, including changing the name of a service item to "Sanjeev Kumar", doubling the number of service items in the response, and finally replacing the entire response with `{"hello": "hi"}`.

Between 10:21 AM and 10:22 AM, minor code cleanups and corrections occurred, mainly improving the structure of the `changeBootstrapMe` function by adding a missing `pretty_url.__contains__(filter)`  condition.  A similar correction for a missing `status_code` assignment was done shortly after.

Around 10:25 AM, there are several commits with seemingly minor changes.  These seem to involve only code formatting and organization rather than functional changes.

Subsequent updates (around 10:26 AM and 10:27 AM) deactivated some functions by commenting them out (e.g., `changeFreddyResponseSuggesterWebSocket`).  This suggests the developer was experimenting with different modification strategies.

A significant change occurred around 10:28 AM. The error message in the `changeFreddyResponseSuggesterWebSocket` function was changed from "NO_RESPONSE_FOUND" to "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS" and finally "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS". This indicates a shift in the intended behavior.

Finally, around 10:30 AM the script is reverted back to an earlier state where the WebSocket response is set to return a "NO_RESPONSE_FOUND" error again.


The frequent modifications to the `response` section for the URL `"api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items"` highlight this as the main target of manipulation throughout the script's development. The changes made to this endpoint show experimentation with different types of modifications.  Thereâ€™s a pattern of adding debugging `ctx.log.warn` statements throughout the code, suggesting iterative development and debugging.


## 2:17:17 PM
The log shows modifications to a single Python file, `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`,  related to intercepting and modifying Freshservice API requests and responses using mitmproxy.  The key changes are focused on manipulating responses for specific API endpoints.


The first two entries (1:41:54 PM and 1:43:22 PM) are nearly identical, differing only in the uncommented/commented status of the `changeFreddyResponseSuggesterWebSocket()` function call within the `websocket_message` method and the `changeFreddyReplySuggestion()` function call within the `response` method.  These changes demonstrate experimentation with enabling/disabling certain interception behaviors.


The third entry (1:43:40 PM) shows a further refinement of the `changeFreddyReplySuggestion` function.  Previously, it simply set the status code to 404; now it modifies the response body to set the "success" field to `False`, indicating a more precise control over the manipulated response.

Throughout the log, several functions modify responses related to the `/api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items` endpoint.  These modifications include changing the name of a service item ("Sanjeev Kumar"), duplicating the service items list (in `updateAdditionalItems`), and even completely replacing the response with a test JSON payload (`changeResponseDirectly`).  There is also manipulation of the pagination parameters ("page") in the  `updateAdditionalItems` function within the `request` method, changing page 2 to 5.

The `changeBootstrapMe` function consistently sets the status code to 404, regardless of log entry.

The `websocket_message` method consistently intercepts and modifies websocket messages related to a "msg" key, replacing it with a JSON indicating no response found.  The consistent use of `ctx.log.warn` for debugging messages is also notable.  The modifications happen very quickly, within a few minutes of each other, suggesting an iterative development or debugging process.
