# Activity Summary for 4/22/2025

## 10:23:09 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to two Dart files within a Flutter project.  The primary focus is on improving a custom WebView component (`custom_web_view_widget.dart`) and its usage in a `FreddyResponseReplyContent` widget.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/webview/custom_web_view_widget.dart`**: This file underwent several revisions between 10:06:30 AM and 10:07:55 AM on April 22, 2025.  The core change involved adding a `minHeight` parameter to the `FSHtmlWidget` within `CustomWebViewWidget`. Initially,  `minHeight` was optional (`double? minHeight`).  There were multiple unsuccessful attempts to conditionally add `minHeight` to the `FSHtmlWidget` constructor. Finally, `minHeight` was set to a default value of 100.0 in the `CustomWebViewWidget` class itself, making it a mandatory parameter.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/components/htmlviewer/fs_html_widget_native.dart`**: This file was updated once at 10:07:30 AM on April 22, 2025.  The update to `FSHtmlWidget`  improved its responsiveness within a `SingleChildScrollView` by dynamically adjusting its height based on the content's actual height after the HTML is fully loaded.  It also added gesture handling to prevent long-press conflicts with the `SingleChildScrollView`.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/ticket/lib/src/ui/response/view/component/freddy_response_reply_content.dart`**:  This file shows a single change at 10:11:45 AM on April 22, 2025,  increasing the `minHeight` property of the embedded `CustomWebViewWidget` from 200 to 700. This suggests an attempt to accommodate more content within the WebView.  This file uses the `CustomWebViewWidget` to display Freddy response content.


The overall pattern indicates iterative development and debugging of the WebView component to ensure proper rendering and responsiveness, especially within nested scrollable layouts. The repeated changes to `custom_web_view_widget.dart`  show a clear focus on resolving the `minHeight` handling.
