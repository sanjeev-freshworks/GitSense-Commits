# Activity Summary for 4/6/2025

## 6:17:17 PM
The log shows a single file, `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, undergoing modifications between 6:13 PM and 6:16 PM on April 6th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: intercepting and modifying HTTP responses related to Freshservice's API, specifically targeting the endpoint  "api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items".

The changes primarily focus on the `websocket_message` function. Initially absent or incomplete, it's gradually refined to check if `flow.websocket` is not None and log a message accordingly, using `ctx.warn`.  This adds websocket handling capability.

The `response` function contains multiple nested functions (`changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, `changeResponseDirectly`) that all manipulate the response body using `json.loads` and `json.dumps`.  `changeAdditionalItems` alters the name of a service item, while `updateAdditionalItems` duplicates and modifies the `serviceItems` list within the JSON response. `changeResponseDirectly` completely overwrites the response with a test JSON.  Only `changeResponseDirectly` is called at the end; the other functions are commented out.

The `request` function includes an `updateAdditionalItems` function that modifies the query parameters of the request if the page is equal to 2, changing it to 5.  This function is called within the `request` function, but the changes made to the request seem irrelevant because only the response is changed later in the code.  The `updateAdditionalItems` function is only indirectly called and not called directly.

In summary, the evolution of the script involves adding websocket handling and focusing on modifying the HTTP response for a specific Freshservice API endpoint. The modifications to the responses are experimental as multiple functions exist but only one is being called.


## 7:17:18 PM
The log shows a series of edits to the `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py` file between 6:17 PM and 6:38 PM on April 6th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is modifying the `websocket_message` and `response` functions within the `InterceptFreshservice` class.

The `websocket_message` function undergoes significant revisions. Initially, it simply logs whether a websocket is present.  Subsequent changes introduce conditional logic based on the existence of "generated_text" within the websocket message content. The function then parses this content as JSON, adds a "msg" key with a JSON value containing either  "Sanjeev Kumar" or an error message ("no instructions found"), and updates the message content.  Logging statements are added throughout to track the original and manipulated message content.  The final version includes careful handling of encoding (using `.encode('utf-8')` for `message.content`).

The `response` function contains multiple nested functions (`changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, `changeResponseDirectly`). While these functions are present throughout the log, their usage is commented out in most versions, with `changeResponseDirectly`  being called in most edits. This function intercepts responses related to  "api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items",  and modifies the response, changing "service_items" array name field from what it was originally to "Sanjeev Kumar".  `updateAdditionalItems` function seems to modify the response by appending the original `serviceItems` array to itself and incrementing the `display_id` of each item.


The `request` function includes `updateAdditionalItems` which modifies the query parameters of requests to the same API endpoint, changing the page number from 2 to 5 if it's initially 2.  This function remains largely unchanged throughout the log.

In summary, the code evolves from a basic websocket and HTTP response logger to a script that actively intercepts and modifies both websocket messages (containing "generated_text") and HTTP responses from a Freshservice API endpoint, specifically manipulating JSON data within those messages and responses.  The changes made demonstrate iterative development, with debugging using logging statements, and a final focus on ensuring the correct encoding of the manipulated JSON data.
