# Activity Summary for 4/6/2025

## 6:17:17 PM
The log shows a single file, `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, undergoing modifications between 6:13 PM and 6:16 PM on April 6th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: intercepting and modifying HTTP responses related to Freshservice's API, specifically targeting the endpoint  "api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items".

The changes primarily focus on the `websocket_message` function. Initially absent or incomplete, it's gradually refined to check if `flow.websocket` is not None and log a message accordingly, using `ctx.warn`.  This adds websocket handling capability.

The `response` function contains multiple nested functions (`changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, `changeResponseDirectly`) that all manipulate the response body using `json.loads` and `json.dumps`.  `changeAdditionalItems` alters the name of a service item, while `updateAdditionalItems` duplicates and modifies the `serviceItems` list within the JSON response. `changeResponseDirectly` completely overwrites the response with a test JSON.  Only `changeResponseDirectly` is called at the end; the other functions are commented out.

The `request` function includes an `updateAdditionalItems` function that modifies the query parameters of the request if the page is equal to 2, changing it to 5.  This function is called within the `request` function, but the changes made to the request seem irrelevant because only the response is changed later in the code.  The `updateAdditionalItems` function is only indirectly called and not called directly.

In summary, the evolution of the script involves adding websocket handling and focusing on modifying the HTTP response for a specific Freshservice API endpoint. The modifications to the responses are experimental as multiple functions exist but only one is being called.
