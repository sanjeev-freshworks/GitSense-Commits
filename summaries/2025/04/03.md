# Activity Summary for 4/3/2025

## 9:43:42 AM
The log shows modifications to `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py` between 9:22 AM and 9:27 AM on April 3rd, 2025.  The script uses the `mitmproxy` library to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses.

The core functionality centers around intercepting requests to the URL containing "api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items".

Initially, the script contained two functions within the `response` method: `changeAdditionalItems`, which modifies the name of a service item to "Sanjeev Kumar", and `updateAdditionalItems`, which duplicates the `service_items` list and increments the `display_id` of each item.  Both functions were called sequentially after intercepting the response.

Between 9:23 AM and 9:27 AM, the code underwent several iterations focusing on the `changeResponseDirectly` function. This function initially called `changeAdditionalItems` and `updateAdditionalItems`, but these calls were subsequently commented out.  The primary change involved directly setting `flow.response.text` to a hardcoded JSON string `'{"hello": "hi"}'`, replacing the previous logic.  There were minor syntax errors in the JSON string assignment corrected over a few commits (missing quotes and incorrect brackets). Finally, the JSON string was correctly assigned using `json.dumps()` to correctly format the JSON data.  The final version of the script only contains the `changeResponseDirectly` function, effectively overriding the original modification functions.  The `request` method remains largely unchanged, only altering the page number in the query parameters if the page is 2.
