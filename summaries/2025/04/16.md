# Activity Summary for 4/16/2025

## 9:38:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py` file between 6:00 AM and 6:14 AM on April 16, 2025.  The script uses the `mitmproxy` library to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses.

The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions: intercepting requests based on URL patterns and manipulating responses or setting status codes.  The changes primarily involve commenting out or uncommenting specific functions and minor adjustments within the functions themselves.

**Key Changes Across Revisions:**

* **6:00:29 AM:** Initial version.  Includes functions to modify responses for various endpoints (`/reply-suggestion`,  endpoints containing "expand", "rephrase", or "tone", "rts-message", "/bootstrap/me", "api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items", "/additional-items", and "/assets/cdn-ignored/sprites"), and handles websocket messages.  The `/additional-items` endpoint is modified to replace all service item names with "Sanjeev Kumar", and also duplicates the service items.  `updateAdditionalItems` modifies the response's pagination, adding items.
* **6:01:13 AM:**  No apparent code changes from the previous version.
* **6:13:59 AM:** No apparent code changes from the previous version.
* **6:14:39 AM:**  The `changeFreddyReplySuggestion` function has its function call commented out.  This removes the functionality to set the success status to `False` for requests to the `/reply-suggestion` endpoint.


**Recurring Elements:**

* Frequent use of `ctx.log.warn` for debugging purposes.
* Consistent use of regular expressions or string matching (`__contains__`) to identify target URLs.
* JSON manipulation is heavily used to alter responses.
* Multiple functions modify responses for different endpoints, suggesting a modular design targeting specific Freshservice API endpoints.


In summary, the revisions show iterative development and debugging, with the primary changes involving enabling/disabling specific response modification functions. The overall goal seems to be testing and manipulating various aspects of the Freshservice API responses.  The lack of substantial code differences between revisions 2, 3, and 4 suggest a period of testing or debugging without significant changes to the core logic.
