# Activity Summary for 4/15/2025

## 3:58:36 PM
The log shows two revisions of `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, both on April 15, 2025.  The changes are minor and primarily involve commenting out function calls.

The first revision (3:05:02 PM) contains several functions within the `InterceptFreshservice` class designed to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses to a Freshservice instance.  These functions target specific URLs or patterns:

*   `/reply-suggestion`: Modifies the response to set `success` to `False`.
*   URLs containing "expand", "rephrase", or "tone": Sets the response status code to 404.
*   `rts-message`: Sets the response status code to 404.
*   `/bootstrap/me`: Sets the response status code to 404.
*   `api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items`:  This URL is targeted by multiple functions. One changes the name of a service item to "Sanjeev Kumar," and another duplicates existing items and modifies their IDs and category IDs.  A third function replaces the entire response body with a minimal structure (`{"service_items": None, "meta": None}`).
*   `/additional-items`: Replaces the response body with `{"service_items": None, "meta": None}`.
*   `/assets/cdn-ignored/sprites`: Replaces the response body with `{"Hello": "World"}`.
*   WebSocket messages: Alters the message content to include an error indicating no instructions were found.


The second revision (3:15:44 PM) is nearly identical, but it removes the function calls `changeResponseDirectly()` and `changeAssetImageResponse()`.  The other functions remain unchanged, although their calls are also commented out, suggesting the modifications are not actively applied in the final version, but the code remains for potential future use.  The core logic and targeted URLs remain consistent between the two revisions.
