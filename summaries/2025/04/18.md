# Activity Summary for 4/18/2025

## 8:34:27 AM
The log details the development of a notification burst handling system.  The core logic, found in `Untitled-3`, manages a deque (likely a double-ended queue) of size `C` (3) to track recent notifications.  A special notification is shown if `C` notifications arrive within a time threshold `T` (15).  The code implements this by comparing the timestamps (T0, T1, etc.) of incoming notifications.  If the difference between the newest and oldest notification in the deque is less than `T`, a special notification is displayed; otherwise, a regular notification is shown.  The system also includes logic for handling cases where the deque is full or empty.  The timestamp of the primary code commit is 4/18/2025, 7:34:49 AM.

The log also contains a substantial to-do list, including improvements to special notification display (e.g., controlling its position, showing it multiple times, adding an icon), testing, automation, and code refactoring.  Specific tasks include  replacing PNGs with SVGs, handling app rotation, and implementing an app review prompt with a 90-day reset mechanism.  There are also several questions about modularity, API calls, data persistence, and the handling of special cases (e.g., solution articles, browser events, on-call users).  The to-do list suggests ongoing development and refinement of the notification system and app review functionality.


## 8:35:25 AM
The log shows a single entry for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/ticket/lib/src/ui/response/presentation/bloc/freddy_response_bloc.dart` on April 18, 2025, at 7:41:29 AM.  This file contains a `FreddyResponseBloc` class, a Flutter BLoC (Business Logic Component) responsible for managing the UI state and logic related to Freddy, a likely AI-powered response suggestion system for support tickets.

The bloc handles various events related to generating replies, refining text, and selecting options from different screens (initial, reply options, tone options, and final).  It interacts with several use cases (`GenerateFreddyReplyUseCase`, `GenerateFreddyReplyOptionsUseCase`, etc.) and models (`FreddyGeneratedReply`, `TicketReplyTemplate`, etc.) to fetch and process data.  The code extensively uses error handling and loading states, managing UI updates based on the success or failure of asynchronous operations.  The bloc also incorporates localization for error messages and other UI elements.  The logic heavily relies on the availability and enabled status of several Freddy features (writing assistant, reply suggester, copilot), retrieved through `_ticketLibInteractor`.  The code also features extensive logging using `FSLogger`.  Conditional logic determines which options are displayed to the user based on ticket status and other factors.  The bloc manages navigation states within the UI, handling transitions between different screens and displaying user messages.


## 10:35:25 AM
The log shows a single code update to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/ticket/lib/src/ui/response/view/component/freddy_response_list_layout_content.dart` on 4/18/2025 at 10:21:44 AM.  This file contains a Flutter widget (`FreddyResponseListLayoutContent`) that displays a list of response options (either reply or tone options).  The widget handles user interaction, logging option clicks using `FSLogger`, and uses a state management pattern involving `FreddyResponseEvent` and `FreddyResponseState`.  The code extensively uses custom widgets and styling from packages like `common_ui`, `core_ui`, and `fs_logger`.  Significant updates include the implementation of a dismissable bottom sheet with a see-through effect,  conditional rendering based on the type of response content (`FreddyResponseContentReplyOptionsScreen` or `FreddyResponseContentToneOptionsScreen`), and handling of enabled/disabled states for options.  The `_onItemClick` function dispatches events based on the selected option and its type.  The visual design leverages themed colors and text styles from `context.theme.fsColorScheme` and `context.theme.fsTextTheme`.


## 12:53:07 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/ticket/lib/src/ui/response/view/component/freddy_response_reply_content.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/components/htmlviewer/fs_html_widget_native.dart` between 10:48 AM and 11:06 AM on April 18, 2025.

The `freddy_response_reply_content.dart` file underwent several minor revisions.  Initially, it displayed content within a `SingleChildScrollView`.  A `ConstrainedBox` was added at 10:50:36 AM to limit the maximum height of the content to 90% of the screen height, improving scrolling behavior.  At 10:54:52 AM, debugging statements were added to  `_buildWebEditText` to log the HTML content, likely for troubleshooting purposes. Finally, at 10:55:06 AM and onward, the outer `Column` in `_buildContent` was wrapped in a `SingleChildScrollView`, which likely intends to handle situations where the content exceeds the available space.

The `fs_html_widget_native.dart` file modifications focused on improving the handling of the WebView widget's height and visibility.  Early versions relied on `LayoutBuilder` to determine the correct height. Between 11:01:07 AM and 11:06:22 AM, the code was modified to load the HTML content only when the widget becomes fully visible (`info.visibleFraction == 1.0`), addressing a height calculation issue when the widget wasn't initially visible within a scrollable area.  A `GestureDetector` was added to handle long-press events correctly, ensuring these events weren't consumed by the parent `SingleChildScrollView`.  The condition in `onVisibilityChanged` was simplified by removing the `info.visibleFraction == 1.0` check,  making the HTML load upon any visibility change, likely for performance optimization. This simplification occurred between 11:06:09 AM and 11:06:22 AM.

In summary, the changes reflect iterative improvements to UI rendering and responsiveness, particularly focusing on handling dynamic content heights within scrollable containers and addressing potential race conditions around WebView loading.  The debugging additions suggest an ongoing troubleshooting process.
