# Activity Summary for 4/18/2025

## 8:34:27 AM
The log details the development of a notification burst handling system.  The core logic, found in `Untitled-3`, manages a deque (likely a double-ended queue) of size `C` (3) to track recent notifications.  A special notification is shown if `C` notifications arrive within a time threshold `T` (15).  The code implements this by comparing the timestamps (T0, T1, etc.) of incoming notifications.  If the difference between the newest and oldest notification in the deque is less than `T`, a special notification is displayed; otherwise, a regular notification is shown.  The system also includes logic for handling cases where the deque is full or empty.  The timestamp of the primary code commit is 4/18/2025, 7:34:49 AM.

The log also contains a substantial to-do list, including improvements to special notification display (e.g., controlling its position, showing it multiple times, adding an icon), testing, automation, and code refactoring.  Specific tasks include  replacing PNGs with SVGs, handling app rotation, and implementing an app review prompt with a 90-day reset mechanism.  There are also several questions about modularity, API calls, data persistence, and the handling of special cases (e.g., solution articles, browser events, on-call users).  The to-do list suggests ongoing development and refinement of the notification system and app review functionality.
