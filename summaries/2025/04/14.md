# Activity Summary for 4/14/2025

## 2:30:53 PM
The log shows a single file, `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, undergoing multiple revisions between 2:03 PM and 2:30 PM on April 14, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on modifying the `response` method within the `InterceptFreshservice` class. This method intercepts HTTP responses from Freshservice and manipulates them.

Specifically, several functions within the `response` method target different Freshservice endpoints: `/reply-suggestion`, URLs containing "expand," "rephrase," or "tone,"  "rts-message," and "/bootstrap/me."  These functions generally set the response status code to 404 (Not Found) to seemingly disable certain Freshservice features.


The most significant and repeatedly modified section is the `updateAdditionalItems` function, which targets the  "api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items" endpoint.  Early versions attempted to modify the page number in requests and the number of items in the response.  Later revisions focused on incrementing the "display_id" and then "category_id" and "id" attributes of items within the response. The final revision increments "display_id", "category_id", and "id" for each item in the duplicated serviceItems list.  The `changeResponseDirectly` function also targets this same endpoint, initially overriding the response with a simple test JSON, then finally replacing it with a large JSON object representing details of Adobe software products.  The  `changeAdditionalItems` function consistently modifies the name of a service item to "Sanjeev Kumar".  These changes suggest an effort to test and refine the manipulation of data within a service catalog.  The commented-out code indicates experimentation with different approaches and the gradual refinement of the functionality.


## 3:30:51 PM
The log shows modifications to a Python script (`freshservice_mitm.py`) between 2:46 PM and 3:01 PM on April 14, 2025.  The script appears designed to intercept and modify Freshservice API requests and responses using `mitmproxy`.

The main focus of the changes is within the `response` method, specifically the `updateAdditionalItems` function.  Early versions of this function incorrectly appended the `service_items` list to itself, resulting in duplicated items. This was corrected by creating a `duplicated_items` list and appending correctly constructed copies of the original items to it, and then adding this list to the original.  This fix significantly improves the logic and prevents unintended data duplication.  This change happened between 2:47:58 PM and 2:52:07 PM.

Other functions within the `response` method (`changeFreddyReplySuggestion`, `changeGenAI`, `changeRTS`, `changeBootstrapMe`, `changeAdditionalItems`) intercept specific URLs and modify responses.  `changeAdditionalItems` alters the name of a service item, while the others appear to set the response status code to 404 (Not Found), effectively blocking those requests.

The `websocket_message` method intercepts and manipulates websocket messages, specifically replacing the "msg" field with an error indicating "no instructions found".

The script consistently uses `json.loads` and `json.dumps` to parse and modify JSON data in both the request and response handling. The `updateAdditionalItems` function shows a clear evolution in the code, starting with an inefficient method and culminating in a corrected, more efficient implementation.


## 4:30:48 PM
The code in `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py` (updated 4/14/2025, 4:01:11 PM) uses `mitmproxy` to intercept and modify Freshservice API requests and responses.  Several functions target specific API endpoints:

* **`/reply-suggestion`**:  Sets the `success` field to `False` in the response.  This likely disables reply suggestions.

* **Endpoints containing "expand", "rephrase", or "tone"**:  Sets the response status code to 404 (Not Found). This appears to disable certain functionalities related to text expansion, rephrasing, or tone adjustments.

* **`rts-message`**: Sets the response status code to 404, likely disabling real-time messaging features.

* **`/bootstrap/me`**: Sets the response status code to 404, potentially affecting user authentication or initialization.

* **`api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items`**: This endpoint receives the most significant modifications.  There are multiple functions targeting it:
    * One function replaces the name of the first service item ("service_items"[0]["name"]) with "Sanjeev Kumar".
    * Another function duplicates all existing service items, increasing the total number of items and pages. It manipulates the `id`, `category_id`, and `display_id` of duplicated items.  The log messages indicate the manipulation process.
    * A final function completely replaces the response with a predefined JSON structure containing detailed information for "Adobe InDesign", "Adobe Premiere Pro CC", and two instances of "Adobe Photoshop CS6"  with different category IDs (29000129063 and 29000129064), showing a difference in how the same product is catalogued.  This offers highly specific data about the products, including system requirements and descriptions.


* **WebSocket interception**: The code intercepts websocket messages, specifically targeting a field named `"msg"`. If present, it replaces the content of `"msg"` with a JSON object indicating "no instructions found". This suggests that it's designed to intercept and modify responses from a generative AI system.

The code uses regular expressions (`re` module) to match specific URL patterns and `json` to parse and manipulate the JSON data within the requests and responses.  The consistent use of `ctx.log.warn` suggests a debugging approach, printing numerous logs to the console to trace changes made during the interception process.


## 7:30:48 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py` file between 6:49 PM and 6:57 PM on April 14, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on modifying HTTP responses and WebSocket messages related to a Freshservice instance.

The `InterceptFreshservice` class intercepts and alters Freshservice API responses and WebSocket messages.  Several functions within the `response` method target specific API endpoints:

*   `/reply-suggestion`: Sets the `success` field to `False` in the response.
*   Endpoints containing "expand," "rephrase," or "tone":  Set the response status code to 404 (Not Found).
*   `rts-message`: Sets the response status code to 404.
*   `/bootstrap/me`: Sets the response status code to 404.
*   `api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items`: This endpoint undergoes the most significant changes across multiple commits. Initially, the name of the first service item is changed to "Sanjeev Kumar." Later, the `updateAdditionalItems` function duplicates service items and modifies pagination metadata (`total_pages` and `total_items`). Finally, the response is modified to return a null `service_items` list and either a null or empty `meta` object in different commits.  The filter for this endpoint is also changed from a more specific filter to `/additional-items` at around 6:54 PM

The `websocket_message` method intercepts WebSocket messages and modifies the `msg` field to indicate "no instructions found," effectively suppressing responses from a component likely named "Freddy Response Suggester".


A recurring pattern is the use of `ctx.log.warn` statements for debugging purposes, providing information on the original and manipulated data.  The `changeResponseDirectly` function's implementation changes across multiple commits reflecting experimentation with different response structures. Finally, the addition of `addons = [InterceptFreshservice()]` at the end of the file in one of the later commits shows the integration of the interceptor into a larger application.  The most significant changes concerning the `/additional-items` endpoint are made between 6:49 PM and 6:57 PM.
