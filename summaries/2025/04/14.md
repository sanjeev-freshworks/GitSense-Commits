# Activity Summary for 4/14/2025

## 2:30:53 PM
The log shows a single file, `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, undergoing multiple revisions between 2:03 PM and 2:30 PM on April 14, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on modifying the `response` method within the `InterceptFreshservice` class. This method intercepts HTTP responses from Freshservice and manipulates them.

Specifically, several functions within the `response` method target different Freshservice endpoints: `/reply-suggestion`, URLs containing "expand," "rephrase," or "tone,"  "rts-message," and "/bootstrap/me."  These functions generally set the response status code to 404 (Not Found) to seemingly disable certain Freshservice features.


The most significant and repeatedly modified section is the `updateAdditionalItems` function, which targets the  "api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items" endpoint.  Early versions attempted to modify the page number in requests and the number of items in the response.  Later revisions focused on incrementing the "display_id" and then "category_id" and "id" attributes of items within the response. The final revision increments "display_id", "category_id", and "id" for each item in the duplicated serviceItems list.  The `changeResponseDirectly` function also targets this same endpoint, initially overriding the response with a simple test JSON, then finally replacing it with a large JSON object representing details of Adobe software products.  The  `changeAdditionalItems` function consistently modifies the name of a service item to "Sanjeev Kumar".  These changes suggest an effort to test and refine the manipulation of data within a service catalog.  The commented-out code indicates experimentation with different approaches and the gradual refinement of the functionality.
