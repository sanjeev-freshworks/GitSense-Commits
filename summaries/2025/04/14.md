# Activity Summary for 4/14/2025

## 2:30:53 PM
The log shows a single file, `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, undergoing multiple revisions between 2:03 PM and 2:30 PM on April 14, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on modifying the `response` method within the `InterceptFreshservice` class. This method intercepts HTTP responses from Freshservice and manipulates them.

Specifically, several functions within the `response` method target different Freshservice endpoints: `/reply-suggestion`, URLs containing "expand," "rephrase," or "tone,"  "rts-message," and "/bootstrap/me."  These functions generally set the response status code to 404 (Not Found) to seemingly disable certain Freshservice features.


The most significant and repeatedly modified section is the `updateAdditionalItems` function, which targets the  "api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items" endpoint.  Early versions attempted to modify the page number in requests and the number of items in the response.  Later revisions focused on incrementing the "display_id" and then "category_id" and "id" attributes of items within the response. The final revision increments "display_id", "category_id", and "id" for each item in the duplicated serviceItems list.  The `changeResponseDirectly` function also targets this same endpoint, initially overriding the response with a simple test JSON, then finally replacing it with a large JSON object representing details of Adobe software products.  The  `changeAdditionalItems` function consistently modifies the name of a service item to "Sanjeev Kumar".  These changes suggest an effort to test and refine the manipulation of data within a service catalog.  The commented-out code indicates experimentation with different approaches and the gradual refinement of the functionality.


## 3:30:51 PM
The log shows modifications to a Python script (`freshservice_mitm.py`) between 2:46 PM and 3:01 PM on April 14, 2025.  The script appears designed to intercept and modify Freshservice API requests and responses using `mitmproxy`.

The main focus of the changes is within the `response` method, specifically the `updateAdditionalItems` function.  Early versions of this function incorrectly appended the `service_items` list to itself, resulting in duplicated items. This was corrected by creating a `duplicated_items` list and appending correctly constructed copies of the original items to it, and then adding this list to the original.  This fix significantly improves the logic and prevents unintended data duplication.  This change happened between 2:47:58 PM and 2:52:07 PM.

Other functions within the `response` method (`changeFreddyReplySuggestion`, `changeGenAI`, `changeRTS`, `changeBootstrapMe`, `changeAdditionalItems`) intercept specific URLs and modify responses.  `changeAdditionalItems` alters the name of a service item, while the others appear to set the response status code to 404 (Not Found), effectively blocking those requests.

The `websocket_message` method intercepts and manipulates websocket messages, specifically replacing the "msg" field with an error indicating "no instructions found".

The script consistently uses `json.loads` and `json.dumps` to parse and modify JSON data in both the request and response handling. The `updateAdditionalItems` function shows a clear evolution in the code, starting with an inefficient method and culminating in a corrected, more efficient implementation.


## 4:30:48 PM
The code in `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py` (updated 4/14/2025, 4:01:11 PM) uses `mitmproxy` to intercept and modify Freshservice API requests and responses.  Several functions target specific API endpoints:

* **`/reply-suggestion`**:  Sets the `success` field to `False` in the response.  This likely disables reply suggestions.

* **Endpoints containing "expand", "rephrase", or "tone"**:  Sets the response status code to 404 (Not Found). This appears to disable certain functionalities related to text expansion, rephrasing, or tone adjustments.

* **`rts-message`**: Sets the response status code to 404, likely disabling real-time messaging features.

* **`/bootstrap/me`**: Sets the response status code to 404, potentially affecting user authentication or initialization.

* **`api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items`**: This endpoint receives the most significant modifications.  There are multiple functions targeting it:
    * One function replaces the name of the first service item ("service_items"[0]["name"]) with "Sanjeev Kumar".
    * Another function duplicates all existing service items, increasing the total number of items and pages. It manipulates the `id`, `category_id`, and `display_id` of duplicated items.  The log messages indicate the manipulation process.
    * A final function completely replaces the response with a predefined JSON structure containing detailed information for "Adobe InDesign", "Adobe Premiere Pro CC", and two instances of "Adobe Photoshop CS6"  with different category IDs (29000129063 and 29000129064), showing a difference in how the same product is catalogued.  This offers highly specific data about the products, including system requirements and descriptions.


* **WebSocket interception**: The code intercepts websocket messages, specifically targeting a field named `"msg"`. If present, it replaces the content of `"msg"` with a JSON object indicating "no instructions found". This suggests that it's designed to intercept and modify responses from a generative AI system.

The code uses regular expressions (`re` module) to match specific URL patterns and `json` to parse and manipulate the JSON data within the requests and responses.  The consistent use of `ctx.log.warn` suggests a debugging approach, printing numerous logs to the console to trace changes made during the interception process.


## 7:30:48 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py` file between 6:49 PM and 6:57 PM on April 14, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on modifying HTTP responses and WebSocket messages related to a Freshservice instance.

The `InterceptFreshservice` class intercepts and alters Freshservice API responses and WebSocket messages.  Several functions within the `response` method target specific API endpoints:

*   `/reply-suggestion`: Sets the `success` field to `False` in the response.
*   Endpoints containing "expand," "rephrase," or "tone":  Set the response status code to 404 (Not Found).
*   `rts-message`: Sets the response status code to 404.
*   `/bootstrap/me`: Sets the response status code to 404.
*   `api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items`: This endpoint undergoes the most significant changes across multiple commits. Initially, the name of the first service item is changed to "Sanjeev Kumar." Later, the `updateAdditionalItems` function duplicates service items and modifies pagination metadata (`total_pages` and `total_items`). Finally, the response is modified to return a null `service_items` list and either a null or empty `meta` object in different commits.  The filter for this endpoint is also changed from a more specific filter to `/additional-items` at around 6:54 PM

The `websocket_message` method intercepts WebSocket messages and modifies the `msg` field to indicate "no instructions found," effectively suppressing responses from a component likely named "Freddy Response Suggester".


A recurring pattern is the use of `ctx.log.warn` statements for debugging purposes, providing information on the original and manipulated data.  The `changeResponseDirectly` function's implementation changes across multiple commits reflecting experimentation with different response structures. Finally, the addition of `addons = [InterceptFreshservice()]` at the end of the file in one of the later commits shows the integration of the interceptor into a larger application.  The most significant changes concerning the `/additional-items` endpoint are made between 6:49 PM and 6:57 PM.


## 8:30:48 PM
The log shows a single file, `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, undergoing multiple revisions between 7:45 PM and 7:46 PM on April 14, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughoutâ€”intercepting and modifying Freshservice API requests and responses.

The changes primarily involve adding new functions within the `response` method of the `InterceptFreshservice` class. Each function targets specific URL patterns or endpoints within Freshservice:

* **`changeFreddyResponseSuggesterWebSocket()`:** Modifies websocket messages related to Freddy (presumably a chatbot), returning a "no instructions found" error. This function is present in all versions but remains largely unchanged.

* **`updateAdditionalItems()`:** Modifies the response for `/api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items` by duplicating existing items and changing pagination metadata. This function is consistently present and relatively stable.

* **`changeFreddyReplySuggestion()`:** Alters the response for `/reply-suggestion` to indicate failure (`"success": False`).

* **`changeGenAI()`**, **`changeRTS()`**, **`changeBootstrapMe()`:** These functions intercept requests containing "expand," "rephrase," "tone," "rts-message," or "/bootstrap/me" in the URL and return a 404 status code.  They are added incrementally.

* **`changeAdditionalItems()`:**  Changes the name of a service item within the response for `/api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items`.  This function is also present in all revisions.

* **`changeResponseDirectly()`:** Replaces the response for `/additional-items` with a minimal JSON object.

* **`changeAssetImageResponse()`:** This function is added in later revisions to set a 404 status code for requests to `/assets/cdn-ignored/sprites`.  The initial version was incomplete.

The pattern is iterative addition and refinement of functions to intercept and manipulate various Freshservice API endpoints, suggesting a debugging or testing process for a MITM proxy script.  The `ctx.log.warn()` statements throughout the code indicate a focus on logging the changes for debugging and monitoring purposes.  The final version of the file, at 7:46:55 PM, includes all mentioned functions and completes the `changeAssetImageResponse` function.


## 9:30:48 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Python script (`freshservice_mitm.py`) designed to intercept and modify HTTP requests and WebSocket messages.  The script uses the `mitmproxy` library.  The main changes revolve around manipulating responses from a Freshservice API.


The most significant changes occur between 9:23 PM and 9:24 PM, with minor adjustments continuing until 9:28 PM.


**File: `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`**

* **9:23:58 PM:**  Initial version. This version includes functions to intercept and modify responses for various Freshservice API endpoints.  Key modifications include changing the name in `/api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items` responses,  modifying the pagination of the same endpoint to show more items, setting a `NO_RESPONSE_FOUND` error in WebSocket messages related to Freddy (presumably a chatbot), and setting HTTP status code 404 for endpoints like `/reply-suggestion`,  URLs containing "expand," "rephrase," or "tone,"  "rts-message," and `/bootstrap/me`. One function, `changeResponseDirectly`, sets a null response for `/additional-items`. Finally,  `changeAssetImageResponse` is commented out.


* **9:24:08 PM:** A minor change in the `changeAssetImageResponse` function. Instead of setting a 404 status code, it attempts to replace the response body with `{"Hello": "World"}`, but there is a syntax error in the code (`jso` instead of `json.dumps`).


* **9:24:15 PM:** The syntax error from the previous revision is corrected, and the `flow.response.text` is correctly set to `json.dumps(testData)`.

* **9:24:24 PM:** The  `changeAssetImageResponse` function is further refined;  the `json.dumps(testData)` is added.


* **9:28:56 PM:** The  `changeAssetImageResponse` function is modified to set the HTTP status code to 404 instead of changing the response body.  The `testData` variable is commented out.


Throughout the revisions, the script consistently uses `ctx.log.warn` for debugging purposes.  The script focuses heavily on manipulating responses related to service items, reply suggestions, and a seemingly AI-related endpoint.  The recurring pattern is intercepting specific URLs and altering the JSON response bodies or the HTTP status codes. The `updateAdditionalItems` function consistently modifies the response to duplicate service items and change pagination.


## 11:45:26 PM
The script `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, updated on 4/14/2025, 9:30:58 PM, uses mitmproxy to intercept and modify Freshservice API responses.  The code intercepts requests based on URL patterns and alters responses accordingly.

Specific modifications include:

* **WebSocket Message Manipulation:**  The `websocket_message` function intercepts WebSocket messages, specifically targeting a JSON field named "msg".  If "msg" exists, its value is replaced with an error message indicating "no instructions found".

* **API Response Modification:** Multiple functions (`changeFreddyReplySuggestion`, `changeGenAI`, `changeRTS`, `changeBootstrapMe`, `changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, `changeResponseDirectly`, `changeAssetImageResponse`) modify responses for various Freshservice API endpoints. These modifications range from setting HTTP status codes to 404 (Not Found) to altering JSON response data. For example, `changeAdditionalItems` changes the name of a service item, and `updateAdditionalItems` duplicates and adds items to the response, increasing the number of pages and items. `changeResponseDirectly` replaces the response body with a simple JSON object.  `changeAssetImageResponse` replaces the response with a different JSON object.

* **Request Parameter Manipulation:** The `updateAdditionalItems` function (within the `request` method) modifies a request parameter ("page") for a specific API endpoint.

The script heavily relies on regular expressions (`__contains__`) for URL matching and uses `json.loads` and `json.dumps` for JSON manipulation.  The consistent use of `ctx.log.warn` suggests a focus on logging the changes made for debugging purposes.  A recurring theme is the manipulation of JSON responses to either simulate errors or inject modified data.
