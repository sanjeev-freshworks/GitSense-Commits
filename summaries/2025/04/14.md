# Activity Summary for 4/14/2025

## 2:30:53 PM
The log shows a single file, `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, undergoing multiple revisions between 2:03 PM and 2:30 PM on April 14, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on modifying the `response` method within the `InterceptFreshservice` class. This method intercepts HTTP responses from Freshservice and manipulates them.

Specifically, several functions within the `response` method target different Freshservice endpoints: `/reply-suggestion`, URLs containing "expand," "rephrase," or "tone,"  "rts-message," and "/bootstrap/me."  These functions generally set the response status code to 404 (Not Found) to seemingly disable certain Freshservice features.


The most significant and repeatedly modified section is the `updateAdditionalItems` function, which targets the  "api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items" endpoint.  Early versions attempted to modify the page number in requests and the number of items in the response.  Later revisions focused on incrementing the "display_id" and then "category_id" and "id" attributes of items within the response. The final revision increments "display_id", "category_id", and "id" for each item in the duplicated serviceItems list.  The `changeResponseDirectly` function also targets this same endpoint, initially overriding the response with a simple test JSON, then finally replacing it with a large JSON object representing details of Adobe software products.  The  `changeAdditionalItems` function consistently modifies the name of a service item to "Sanjeev Kumar".  These changes suggest an effort to test and refine the manipulation of data within a service catalog.  The commented-out code indicates experimentation with different approaches and the gradual refinement of the functionality.


## 3:30:51 PM
The log shows modifications to a Python script (`freshservice_mitm.py`) between 2:46 PM and 3:01 PM on April 14, 2025.  The script appears designed to intercept and modify Freshservice API requests and responses using `mitmproxy`.

The main focus of the changes is within the `response` method, specifically the `updateAdditionalItems` function.  Early versions of this function incorrectly appended the `service_items` list to itself, resulting in duplicated items. This was corrected by creating a `duplicated_items` list and appending correctly constructed copies of the original items to it, and then adding this list to the original.  This fix significantly improves the logic and prevents unintended data duplication.  This change happened between 2:47:58 PM and 2:52:07 PM.

Other functions within the `response` method (`changeFreddyReplySuggestion`, `changeGenAI`, `changeRTS`, `changeBootstrapMe`, `changeAdditionalItems`) intercept specific URLs and modify responses.  `changeAdditionalItems` alters the name of a service item, while the others appear to set the response status code to 404 (Not Found), effectively blocking those requests.

The `websocket_message` method intercepts and manipulates websocket messages, specifically replacing the "msg" field with an error indicating "no instructions found".

The script consistently uses `json.loads` and `json.dumps` to parse and modify JSON data in both the request and response handling. The `updateAdditionalItems` function shows a clear evolution in the code, starting with an inefficient method and culminating in a corrected, more efficient implementation.
