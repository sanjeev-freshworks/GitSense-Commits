# Activity Summary for 4/25/2025

## 12:05:20 PM
The log shows three revisions of the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/itildesk/public/javascripts/workflow/templates/forms/placeholder.jst.ejs` file, all within a short time frame on April 25th, 2025.  The changes are primarily within the `<script>` section, indicating modifications to the JavaScript functionality of a placeholder element.


The first two revisions (11:55:48 AM and 11:56:26 AM) are nearly identical. The only discernible difference lies within a comment in the placeholder item click handler:  The first revision includes  `fs_freddy_translation_1001388361_24241_b9d44446-13c0-414a-a9d6-e962cbbcbcf8` while the second adds `Getting RTS params for channels: [fs_freddy_detection_1001388361_24241_ed23203a-0009-48b5-b126-3c927f4bf976, fs_freddy_translation_1001388361_24241_b9d44446-13c0-414a-a9d6-e962cbbcbcf8], source: freddy`.  This suggests the addition of real-time system (RTS) parameter retrieval for channels related to "freddy," possibly indicating integration with a Freddy-named system or service.


The third revision (11:57:01 AM) expands the comment further, adding more channels related to `ticket_details` within the same RTS parameter retrieval section: `[fs_writing_assistant_24241_1001388361_31051e65-1957-4113-8057-3a4dd1814b2d, fs_ticket_details_response_suggester_46800_1001388361, fs_ticket_details_acknowledgement_46800_1001388361, fs_ticket_details_more_info_46800_1001388361, fs_ticket_details_confirm_resolution_46800_1001388361, fs_ticket_details_follow_up_46800_1001388361], source: ticket_details`. This indicates a significant extension of the RTS integration to include ticket details functionality.


The HTML portion of the file remains unchanged across all three revisions.  The JavaScript code focuses heavily on event handling (`on('click', ...`),  DOM manipulation using jQuery, and interactions with  modal windows and text editors (potentially Redactor and CodeMirror). The code suggests a system for managing placeholders, likely within a workflow or form-building context.


## 1:05:18 PM
The log shows three nearly identical updates to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/itildesk/public/javascripts/workflow/templates/forms/placeholder.jst.ejs` within a short time frame (between 12:28 PM and 12:29 PM on 4/25/2025).  The changes are minimal. The only difference lies within the Javascript section of the code, specifically inside the  `placeholder-list button, .placeholder-list a.ph-btn` click handler. A `detectLangChannel` variable and assignment has been added between the second and third commits.  The file is a Javascript template that appears to manage placeholder elements within a modal dialog. The Javascript code handles placeholder insertion into various text editors (Redactor, CodeMirror), manages dropdown menus for selecting placeholder context, and interacts with a modal dialog (`#place-dialog`, `#workflow-modal`).  The code suggests integration with a service catalog (`/catalog/items/fetch_catalog_items`). The repeated updates suggest iterative debugging or minor adjustments to the placeholder functionality, particularly related to language detection (`fs_freddy_detection...`).
