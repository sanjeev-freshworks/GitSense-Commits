# Activity Summary for 4/21/2025

## 12:11:43 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, a Python script likely used for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests and responses related to Freshservice.  The main changes revolve around modifying responses to various Freshservice API endpoints.

The script uses `mitmproxy` to intercept traffic.  The `InterceptFreshservice` class contains several functions to modify responses based on URL patterns. These functions often involve parsing the JSON response body, making changes (e.g., changing names, setting error codes, manipulating pagination), and then sending the modified response.

Between 11:59:06 AM and 12:01:26 PM, several small modifications were made.  The most significant change occurred in the `changeFreddyResponseSuggesterWebSocket` function.  Initially (11:59:06 AM), the manipulated response included the error code  `"NO_RESPONSE_FOUND"`. This was later changed to `"TOO_MANY_REQUESTS"` at 12:01:06 PM.  Other functions, like `changeGenAI`, `changeRTS`, `changeBootstrapMe`, and  `changeAdditionalItems`, had commented-out calls to themselves, and some were uncommented in later revisions. This suggests an iterative debugging or experimentation process. The `updateAdditionalItems` function consistently duplicates items in the response, suggesting a test to simulate a larger dataset.  The `changeResponseDirectly` function consistently sets the response body to `{"service_items":None,"meta":None}`, potentially for testing purposes.


The frequent, small updates suggest a rapid iteration cycle, perhaps while testing or developing the script.  The commenting-out and uncommenting of function calls within the response function is a clear indicator of this iterative process. The focus is consistently on manipulating JSON responses within the Freshservice API.


## 2:11:43 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/ticket/lib/src/ui/analytics/ticket_analytics_util.dart` between 1:42 PM and 1:53 PM on April 21, 2025.  The file contains a `TicketAnalyticsUtil` class which is populated with a set of constant strings, apparently for tracking analytics events.

The changes primarily involve adding new constants related to "Freddy Response Suggester," which appears to be a feature within a Freshservice mobile application.  These constants track various user interactions, categorized by screen and action.  The screens identified include an initial screen ("FreddyReplyMenu"), a reply options screen ("FreddyReplyOptions"), tone options screen ("FreddyReplyToneOptions"), and a final screen ("FreddyGeneratedReply").

Initially, only a few actions were tracked for the "Reply Options" and "Initial" screens.  Over time, more actions were added to the "Reply Options" screen (acknowledge, request more information, follow up, confirm resolution, and rephrase), and  "Tone Options" screen (friendly, professional, casual, and empathetic).  The "Final" screen's actions were also expanded to include different success and failure scenarios for reply generation, acknowledgment, requesting more information, and follow-up actions.  Finally, an "Insert Text" action was added to the "Final" screen.

There is a noticeable pattern in the naming convention of the constants: `freddy[ScreenName][Action]`.  The timestamps show a rapid succession of edits suggesting iterative development or refinement of the analytics tracking.  There were a couple of instances where a constant was added and then an almost identical constant with a minor edit was re-added in quick succession. This suggests some mistakes in copy-pasting and correcting typos during development.  The final state of the code includes comprehensive analytics tracking for success and failure scenarios for multiple actions across the different screens within the Freddy Response Suggester feature.


## 3:11:43 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/ticket/lib/src/ui/analytics/ticket_analytics_util.dart` between 2:12 PM and 2:15 PM on April 21, 2025.  The file defines a `TicketAnalyticsUtil` class containing numerous `static const String` variables, each representing an analytics event. These events are categorized into sections within the class using region comments: "Freddy Response Suggester - Initial screen," "Freddy Response Suggester - Reply Options screen," "Freddy Response Suggester - Tone Options screen," and "Freddy Response Suggester - Final screen."

The changes primarily involve adding new analytics events, particularly within the "Freddy Response Suggester - Final screen" region.  Initially, this region tracked success and failure for reply generation, acknowledgment, requesting more information, follow-up, and resolution confirmation.  Subsequent commits added events for inserting text, expanding text, rephrasing text, and enhancing tone. For each of these actions, success and failure states were also tracked.  The final commit adds failure states for expanding, rephrasing, and enhancing tone.  There is a small typo correction in "Insert text" to "Insert text" consistently across success and failure.


The most significant changes occurred in quick succession between approximately 2:13 PM and 2:15 PM, as multiple events related to text manipulation (expand, rephrase, enhance tone) were added to the "Freddy Response Suggester - Final screen" section, along with their corresponding success and failure states.  The addition of failure cases indicates a more robust error handling strategy in the application's analytics.  No other files are modified in the provided log.


## 4:11:43 PM
The script `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, last modified on 4/21/2025, 4:02:41 PM, is a Mitmproxy script designed to intercept and modify Freshservice API responses.  It uses several functions to alter responses based on URL patterns.

The `websocket_message` function intercepts websocket messages and specifically modifies the `msg` field of JSON data within those messages, replacing it with an error message indicating "no instructions found".

The `request` function contains a `updateAdditionalItems` function which modifies query parameters; specifically, it changes the `page` parameter from 2 to 5 for requests to `/api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items`.

The `response` function includes multiple functions that intercept and modify responses based on URL filters.  These functions include:

*   `changeFreddyReplySuggestion`: Sets the "success" field to `False` in JSON responses containing `/reply-suggestion`.
*   `changeGenAI`, `changeRTS`, and `changeBootstrapMe`: Set the status code to 404 for requests containing "expand", "rephrase", "tone", "rts-message", and "/bootstrap/me" respectively.
*   `changeAdditionalItems`:  Replaces the name of the first service item in `/api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items` responses with "Sanjeev Kumar".
*   `updateAdditionalItems`: Duplicates items in `/api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items` responses, increasing `id`, `category_id`, and `display_id` for each duplicated item, resulting in a larger response with twice the number of original items.
*   `changeResponseDirectly`: Replaces the response body of requests to `/additional-items` with a simple JSON object `{"service_items":None,"meta":None}`.
*   `changeAssetImageResponse`: Replaces the response body of requests to `/assets/cdn-ignored/sprites` with `{"Hello": "World"}`.

The script uses extensive logging via `ctx.log.warn` to track its actions.  A recurring pattern is the use of URL filtering (`flow.request.pretty_url.__contains__`) to target specific API endpoints for modification.  The script significantly alters Freshservice responses, likely for testing or debugging purposes.


## 5:11:44 PM
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py` file over a short period (approximately 30 minutes) on April 21, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is modifying the responses from a Freshservice API.

The code defines an `InterceptFreshservice` class that intercepts HTTP requests and responses, as well as websocket messages.  Many functions within the class (`changeFreddyReplySuggestion`, `changeGenAI`, `changeRTS`, `changeBootstrapMe`, `changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, `changeResponseDirectly`, `changeAssetImageResponse`) intercept specific URLs based on string matching within the `flow.request.pretty_url` attribute.

Significant changes include:

* **4:41:33 PM:** Initial version.  This version contains mostly commented-out function calls, except for the `websocket_message` and `request` functions which contain some active code and `changeAdditionalItems`. The `updateAdditionalItems` function is also active in this version which duplicates existing service items.

* **4:53:11 PM - 4:54:40 PM:** Multiple edits occur within a short timeframe, primarily uncommenting various functions in the `response` method. This gradually enables more interception logic, activating functions that modify responses by setting `status_code` to 404 (Not Found) or manipulating JSON data within the responses.  The `changeAdditionalItems` function alters the name of a service item.

* **4:58:31 PM - 4:59:33 PM:** A new function `changeFreddyResponseSuggester()` is added to handle `/freddy-suggestion` URLs,  modifying the response's JSON data to set the "articles" field to an empty array.


* **5:00:01 PM - 5:01:53 PM:** The `changeFreddyResponseSuggester()` function is activated by uncommenting its call.  Also, the `data["articles"]` is modified to set it to `None` instead of an empty array. Minor changes to other functions include commenting out some active calls to other functions, making them inactive.


The overarching pattern is the incremental enabling of interception and modification logic within the `response` method. The developer appears to be iteratively testing different interception points and response manipulations.  The frequent commenting and uncommenting of function calls suggest a debugging or experimentation process. The `updateAdditionalItems` function which modifies pagination and duplicates service items is also present throughout the changes, suggesting it may be an important element of the script's functionality.


## 8:14:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/ticket/lib/src/ui/response/presentation/bloc/freddy_response_bloc.dart` file between 7:53 PM and 8:10 PM on April 21, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor and iterative, focusing on the `FreddyResponseBloc` class.  There are no substantial structural changes to the code across the revisions.  The primary modifications seem to be related to error handling and potentially minor adjustments to the logic within the `_handleReplyOptions` function, particularly around retry logic based on `freddyError.canRetry`.  The timestamps suggest a short period of active development and debugging of the error handling within the bloc.  The core functionality of the bloc, handling various FreddyResponseEvents and updating the FreddyResponseState, remains consistent throughout the revisions.
