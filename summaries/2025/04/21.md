# Activity Summary for 4/21/2025

## 12:11:43 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, a Python script likely used for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests and responses related to Freshservice.  The main changes revolve around modifying responses to various Freshservice API endpoints.

The script uses `mitmproxy` to intercept traffic.  The `InterceptFreshservice` class contains several functions to modify responses based on URL patterns. These functions often involve parsing the JSON response body, making changes (e.g., changing names, setting error codes, manipulating pagination), and then sending the modified response.

Between 11:59:06 AM and 12:01:26 PM, several small modifications were made.  The most significant change occurred in the `changeFreddyResponseSuggesterWebSocket` function.  Initially (11:59:06 AM), the manipulated response included the error code  `"NO_RESPONSE_FOUND"`. This was later changed to `"TOO_MANY_REQUESTS"` at 12:01:06 PM.  Other functions, like `changeGenAI`, `changeRTS`, `changeBootstrapMe`, and  `changeAdditionalItems`, had commented-out calls to themselves, and some were uncommented in later revisions. This suggests an iterative debugging or experimentation process. The `updateAdditionalItems` function consistently duplicates items in the response, suggesting a test to simulate a larger dataset.  The `changeResponseDirectly` function consistently sets the response body to `{"service_items":None,"meta":None}`, potentially for testing purposes.


The frequent, small updates suggest a rapid iteration cycle, perhaps while testing or developing the script.  The commenting-out and uncommenting of function calls within the response function is a clear indicator of this iterative process. The focus is consistently on manipulating JSON responses within the Freshservice API.


## 2:11:43 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/ticket/lib/src/ui/analytics/ticket_analytics_util.dart` between 1:42 PM and 1:53 PM on April 21, 2025.  The file contains a `TicketAnalyticsUtil` class which is populated with a set of constant strings, apparently for tracking analytics events.

The changes primarily involve adding new constants related to "Freddy Response Suggester," which appears to be a feature within a Freshservice mobile application.  These constants track various user interactions, categorized by screen and action.  The screens identified include an initial screen ("FreddyReplyMenu"), a reply options screen ("FreddyReplyOptions"), tone options screen ("FreddyReplyToneOptions"), and a final screen ("FreddyGeneratedReply").

Initially, only a few actions were tracked for the "Reply Options" and "Initial" screens.  Over time, more actions were added to the "Reply Options" screen (acknowledge, request more information, follow up, confirm resolution, and rephrase), and  "Tone Options" screen (friendly, professional, casual, and empathetic).  The "Final" screen's actions were also expanded to include different success and failure scenarios for reply generation, acknowledgment, requesting more information, and follow-up actions.  Finally, an "Insert Text" action was added to the "Final" screen.

There is a noticeable pattern in the naming convention of the constants: `freddy[ScreenName][Action]`.  The timestamps show a rapid succession of edits suggesting iterative development or refinement of the analytics tracking.  There were a couple of instances where a constant was added and then an almost identical constant with a minor edit was re-added in quick succession. This suggests some mistakes in copy-pasting and correcting typos during development.  The final state of the code includes comprehensive analytics tracking for success and failure scenarios for multiple actions across the different screens within the Freddy Response Suggester feature.


## 3:11:43 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/ticket/lib/src/ui/analytics/ticket_analytics_util.dart` between 2:12 PM and 2:15 PM on April 21, 2025.  The file defines a `TicketAnalyticsUtil` class containing numerous `static const String` variables, each representing an analytics event. These events are categorized into sections within the class using region comments: "Freddy Response Suggester - Initial screen," "Freddy Response Suggester - Reply Options screen," "Freddy Response Suggester - Tone Options screen," and "Freddy Response Suggester - Final screen."

The changes primarily involve adding new analytics events, particularly within the "Freddy Response Suggester - Final screen" region.  Initially, this region tracked success and failure for reply generation, acknowledgment, requesting more information, follow-up, and resolution confirmation.  Subsequent commits added events for inserting text, expanding text, rephrasing text, and enhancing tone. For each of these actions, success and failure states were also tracked.  The final commit adds failure states for expanding, rephrasing, and enhancing tone.  There is a small typo correction in "Insert text" to "Insert text" consistently across success and failure.


The most significant changes occurred in quick succession between approximately 2:13 PM and 2:15 PM, as multiple events related to text manipulation (expand, rephrase, enhance tone) were added to the "Freddy Response Suggester - Final screen" section, along with their corresponding success and failure states.  The addition of failure cases indicates a more robust error handling strategy in the application's analytics.  No other files are modified in the provided log.


## 4:11:43 PM
The script `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, last modified on 4/21/2025, 4:02:41 PM, is a Mitmproxy script designed to intercept and modify Freshservice API responses.  It uses several functions to alter responses based on URL patterns.

The `websocket_message` function intercepts websocket messages and specifically modifies the `msg` field of JSON data within those messages, replacing it with an error message indicating "no instructions found".

The `request` function contains a `updateAdditionalItems` function which modifies query parameters; specifically, it changes the `page` parameter from 2 to 5 for requests to `/api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items`.

The `response` function includes multiple functions that intercept and modify responses based on URL filters.  These functions include:

*   `changeFreddyReplySuggestion`: Sets the "success" field to `False` in JSON responses containing `/reply-suggestion`.
*   `changeGenAI`, `changeRTS`, and `changeBootstrapMe`: Set the status code to 404 for requests containing "expand", "rephrase", "tone", "rts-message", and "/bootstrap/me" respectively.
*   `changeAdditionalItems`:  Replaces the name of the first service item in `/api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items` responses with "Sanjeev Kumar".
*   `updateAdditionalItems`: Duplicates items in `/api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items` responses, increasing `id`, `category_id`, and `display_id` for each duplicated item, resulting in a larger response with twice the number of original items.
*   `changeResponseDirectly`: Replaces the response body of requests to `/additional-items` with a simple JSON object `{"service_items":None,"meta":None}`.
*   `changeAssetImageResponse`: Replaces the response body of requests to `/assets/cdn-ignored/sprites` with `{"Hello": "World"}`.

The script uses extensive logging via `ctx.log.warn` to track its actions.  A recurring pattern is the use of URL filtering (`flow.request.pretty_url.__contains__`) to target specific API endpoints for modification.  The script significantly alters Freshservice responses, likely for testing or debugging purposes.


## 5:11:44 PM
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py` file over a short period (approximately 30 minutes) on April 21, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is modifying the responses from a Freshservice API.

The code defines an `InterceptFreshservice` class that intercepts HTTP requests and responses, as well as websocket messages.  Many functions within the class (`changeFreddyReplySuggestion`, `changeGenAI`, `changeRTS`, `changeBootstrapMe`, `changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, `changeResponseDirectly`, `changeAssetImageResponse`) intercept specific URLs based on string matching within the `flow.request.pretty_url` attribute.

Significant changes include:

* **4:41:33 PM:** Initial version.  This version contains mostly commented-out function calls, except for the `websocket_message` and `request` functions which contain some active code and `changeAdditionalItems`. The `updateAdditionalItems` function is also active in this version which duplicates existing service items.

* **4:53:11 PM - 4:54:40 PM:** Multiple edits occur within a short timeframe, primarily uncommenting various functions in the `response` method. This gradually enables more interception logic, activating functions that modify responses by setting `status_code` to 404 (Not Found) or manipulating JSON data within the responses.  The `changeAdditionalItems` function alters the name of a service item.

* **4:58:31 PM - 4:59:33 PM:** A new function `changeFreddyResponseSuggester()` is added to handle `/freddy-suggestion` URLs,  modifying the response's JSON data to set the "articles" field to an empty array.


* **5:00:01 PM - 5:01:53 PM:** The `changeFreddyResponseSuggester()` function is activated by uncommenting its call.  Also, the `data["articles"]` is modified to set it to `None` instead of an empty array. Minor changes to other functions include commenting out some active calls to other functions, making them inactive.


The overarching pattern is the incremental enabling of interception and modification logic within the `response` method. The developer appears to be iteratively testing different interception points and response manipulations.  The frequent commenting and uncommenting of function calls suggest a debugging or experimentation process. The `updateAdditionalItems` function which modifies pagination and duplicates service items is also present throughout the changes, suggesting it may be an important element of the script's functionality.


## 8:14:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/ticket/lib/src/ui/response/presentation/bloc/freddy_response_bloc.dart` file between 7:53 PM and 8:10 PM on April 21, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor and iterative, focusing on the `FreddyResponseBloc` class.  There are no substantial structural changes to the code across the revisions.  The primary modifications seem to be related to error handling and potentially minor adjustments to the logic within the `_handleReplyOptions` function, particularly around retry logic based on `freddyError.canRetry`.  The timestamps suggest a short period of active development and debugging of the error handling within the bloc.  The core functionality of the bloc, handling various FreddyResponseEvents and updating the FreddyResponseState, remains consistent throughout the revisions.


## 9:11:42 PM
The log shows two nearly identical commits to `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, separated by 8 seconds (8:51:40 PM and 8:51:48 PM).  Both commits modify the `freshservice_mitm.py` script, which appears to be a MITM proxy script for intercepting and modifying Freshservice API requests and responses.

The key changes between the two commits are subtle. In the second commit, within the `changeFreddyResponseSuggester()` function, `data["articles"]` is changed from `[None]` to `[]`. This indicates a minor adjustment in how a response for `/freddy-suggestion` is manipulated; instead of setting the `articles` field to a single `None` value, it's now set to an empty list.

The script extensively uses functions like `changeFreddyReplySuggestion`, `changeFreddyResponseSuggester`, `changeGenAI`, `changeRTS`, `changeBootstrapMe`, `changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, and `changeResponseDirectly` to intercept and modify HTTP responses based on URLs.  The script also intercepts and modifies websocket messages using `changeFreddyResponseSuggesterWebSocket`.  A common pattern is to intercept requests, parse the JSON response, modify specific fields, and then send the modified JSON back.  The `updateAdditionalItems` function demonstrates a more complex manipulation, duplicating existing items in the response.  The `changeAssetImageResponse` function replaces the response with a simple test JSON object.  The `ctx.log.warn` statements throughout the code are used for debugging purposes.


## 9:11:54 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/ticket/lib/src/ui/response/presentation/bloc/freddy_response_bloc.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/ticket/test/ui/freddy_response_bloc_test.dart` between 8:15 PM and 8:34 PM on April 21, 2025.

The `/features/ticket/lib/src/ui/response/presentation/bloc/freddy_response_bloc.dart` file underwent several minor revisions focusing primarily on error handling and event management within the `FreddyResponseBloc`.  Changes include renaming functions (`sendReplyOptionEvent` to `_sendReplyOptionEvent`, `sendReplyOptionClickedEvent` to `_sendReplyOptionClickedEvent`), and improvements to error handling within the `_handleReplyOptions` function, adding handling for `UCErrorResult`.  The loading message in the initial `FreddyResponseState` was also modified.  The most significant change appears to be around enhancing the robustness of the reply option handling to gracefully manage error scenarios.

The `/features/ticket/test/ui/freddy_response_bloc_test.dart` file  shows additions to the test suite for `FreddyResponseBloc`.  The tests cover various scenarios including:

* Initial state emissions for different source screens.
* Loading and handling of reply options.
* Loading and handling of tone options, including empty content scenarios.
* Handling of expand and rephrase text events, encompassing both success and error cases.
* Navigation to the insert reply screen after a final screen event.

The series of revisions to `freddy_response_bloc.dart` suggest iterative debugging and refinement to the bloc's functionality, with the unit tests in `freddy_response_bloc_test.dart` reflecting this process.  The  `_isFreddyConfigsEnabled` function consistently checks for Freddy Writing Assistant and Reply Suggester availability, highlighting a recurring pattern of checking for feature availability.  The final version includes  `FSAnalytics` for tracking events, indicating a focus on analytics integration.  The  `FreddyResponseOptionType` file shows additions to cover the `EnhanceToneOption` enum, likely coinciding with functionality added to the Bloc.


## 10:11:48 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two Dart files within the Freshservice project, specifically focusing on the `freddy_response_bloc.dart` and `freddy_response_grid_layout_content.dart` files.  The majority of changes are concentrated within a short timeframe between 9:12 PM and 9:17 PM on April 21, 2025, indicating intensive development or debugging.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/ticket/lib/src/ui/response/presentation/bloc/freddy_response_bloc.dart`: This file underwent several revisions, primarily modifying the `_getTicketReplyTemplate` function.  The initial versions had a loading message that was either missing or just a placeholder.  Later revisions changed the loading message to  `'Loading Freddy Response Suggester'` and finally to `localizations.load` (presumably fetching it from the localization file), and  `localizations.loaderTitleForFreddy` in the final version, suggesting an improvement in the user experience during loading.  Other changes involved minor code adjustments and parameter additions in different functions, such as adding  `TicketLocalizations localizations` parameter in  `_getOptionsForReplyOptionsScreen` and `_getTicketReplyTemplate` functions, indicating improvements in handling localization.  The changes consistently center around the `FreddyResponseBloc` class, focusing on event handling, state management, and the use of use cases like `_generateFreddyReplyOptionsUseCase` and `_getTicketReplyTemplateUseCase`.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/ticket/lib/src/ui/response/view/component/freddy_response_grid_layout_content.dart`: This file had two revisions, primarily focusing on the UI layout and button design within the `_buildButton` function.  The most notable change is the addition of an `Expanded` widget within the `Row` inside the `_buildButton` function to improve text handling. This suggests adjustments were made to handle varying text lengths within the grid layout.  The overall structure of the layout remained consistent, mainly focusing on improvements to button appearance and responsiveness.  The timestamps indicate these UI changes occurred later, after the bloc logic was refined.  The consistent use of `context.theme.fsColorScheme` suggests adherence to a pre-defined design system for theme management.


## 11:11:45 PM
The script `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, modified on 2025-04-21 23:09:50, is a mitmproxy script designed to intercept and modify Freshservice API responses.  It uses regular expressions to target specific URLs.

The script's core functionality involves modifying responses for various Freshservice endpoints.  Key modifications include:

* **`/freddy-suggestion`**:  The `articles` array in the response is emptied.
* **`/reply-suggestion`**: The `success` field in the response is set to `False`.
* **Endpoints containing "expand", "rephrase", or "tone"**: The response status code is set to 404.
* **`rts-message`**: The response status code is set to 404.
* **`/bootstrap/me`**: The response status code is set to 404.
* **`api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items`**: This endpoint undergoes multiple modifications:
    * The name of the first service item is changed to "Sanjeev Kumar".
    * The pagination is manipulated to simulate more items (total_pages and total_items are altered).  Duplicate service items are added.
    * In another function, the response is completely overwritten with a `testData` object containing only `null` values for "service_items" and "meta".
* **`/additional-items`**: The response is replaced with a minimal JSON object.
* **`/assets/cdn-ignored/sprites`**: The response is replaced with `{"Hello": "World"}`.

The script also includes a `websocket_message` function that intercepts and modifies WebSocket messages, specifically targeting the "msg" field within the JSON payload and replacing its value with an error message indicating "no instructions found."

The script extensively uses `ctx.log.warn` for logging purposes, providing detailed information about the intercepted requests and the modifications made.  There's a pattern of intercepting requests based on URL segments and altering response data or status codes.  The modifications are primarily focused on altering data within the responses or replacing the entire response with alternative JSON structures.
