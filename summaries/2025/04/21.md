# Activity Summary for 4/21/2025

## 12:11:43 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, a Python script likely used for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests and responses related to Freshservice.  The main changes revolve around modifying responses to various Freshservice API endpoints.

The script uses `mitmproxy` to intercept traffic.  The `InterceptFreshservice` class contains several functions to modify responses based on URL patterns. These functions often involve parsing the JSON response body, making changes (e.g., changing names, setting error codes, manipulating pagination), and then sending the modified response.

Between 11:59:06 AM and 12:01:26 PM, several small modifications were made.  The most significant change occurred in the `changeFreddyResponseSuggesterWebSocket` function.  Initially (11:59:06 AM), the manipulated response included the error code  `"NO_RESPONSE_FOUND"`. This was later changed to `"TOO_MANY_REQUESTS"` at 12:01:06 PM.  Other functions, like `changeGenAI`, `changeRTS`, `changeBootstrapMe`, and  `changeAdditionalItems`, had commented-out calls to themselves, and some were uncommented in later revisions. This suggests an iterative debugging or experimentation process. The `updateAdditionalItems` function consistently duplicates items in the response, suggesting a test to simulate a larger dataset.  The `changeResponseDirectly` function consistently sets the response body to `{"service_items":None,"meta":None}`, potentially for testing purposes.


The frequent, small updates suggest a rapid iteration cycle, perhaps while testing or developing the script.  The commenting-out and uncommenting of function calls within the response function is a clear indicator of this iterative process. The focus is consistently on manipulating JSON responses within the Freshservice API.


## 2:11:43 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/ticket/lib/src/ui/analytics/ticket_analytics_util.dart` between 1:42 PM and 1:53 PM on April 21, 2025.  The file contains a `TicketAnalyticsUtil` class which is populated with a set of constant strings, apparently for tracking analytics events.

The changes primarily involve adding new constants related to "Freddy Response Suggester," which appears to be a feature within a Freshservice mobile application.  These constants track various user interactions, categorized by screen and action.  The screens identified include an initial screen ("FreddyReplyMenu"), a reply options screen ("FreddyReplyOptions"), tone options screen ("FreddyReplyToneOptions"), and a final screen ("FreddyGeneratedReply").

Initially, only a few actions were tracked for the "Reply Options" and "Initial" screens.  Over time, more actions were added to the "Reply Options" screen (acknowledge, request more information, follow up, confirm resolution, and rephrase), and  "Tone Options" screen (friendly, professional, casual, and empathetic).  The "Final" screen's actions were also expanded to include different success and failure scenarios for reply generation, acknowledgment, requesting more information, and follow-up actions.  Finally, an "Insert Text" action was added to the "Final" screen.

There is a noticeable pattern in the naming convention of the constants: `freddy[ScreenName][Action]`.  The timestamps show a rapid succession of edits suggesting iterative development or refinement of the analytics tracking.  There were a couple of instances where a constant was added and then an almost identical constant with a minor edit was re-added in quick succession. This suggests some mistakes in copy-pasting and correcting typos during development.  The final state of the code includes comprehensive analytics tracking for success and failure scenarios for multiple actions across the different screens within the Freddy Response Suggester feature.
