# Activity Summary for 4/21/2025

## 12:11:43 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, a Python script likely used for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests and responses related to Freshservice.  The main changes revolve around modifying responses to various Freshservice API endpoints.

The script uses `mitmproxy` to intercept traffic.  The `InterceptFreshservice` class contains several functions to modify responses based on URL patterns. These functions often involve parsing the JSON response body, making changes (e.g., changing names, setting error codes, manipulating pagination), and then sending the modified response.

Between 11:59:06 AM and 12:01:26 PM, several small modifications were made.  The most significant change occurred in the `changeFreddyResponseSuggesterWebSocket` function.  Initially (11:59:06 AM), the manipulated response included the error code  `"NO_RESPONSE_FOUND"`. This was later changed to `"TOO_MANY_REQUESTS"` at 12:01:06 PM.  Other functions, like `changeGenAI`, `changeRTS`, `changeBootstrapMe`, and  `changeAdditionalItems`, had commented-out calls to themselves, and some were uncommented in later revisions. This suggests an iterative debugging or experimentation process. The `updateAdditionalItems` function consistently duplicates items in the response, suggesting a test to simulate a larger dataset.  The `changeResponseDirectly` function consistently sets the response body to `{"service_items":None,"meta":None}`, potentially for testing purposes.


The frequent, small updates suggest a rapid iteration cycle, perhaps while testing or developing the script.  The commenting-out and uncommenting of function calls within the response function is a clear indicator of this iterative process. The focus is consistently on manipulating JSON responses within the Freshservice API.
