# Activity Summary for 4/23/2025

## 10:06:28 AM
The provided log shows a GitHub workflow file (`pr_checks.yaml`) defining a CI/CD pipeline for a Flutter mobile application.  The workflow, updated on April 23, 2025, at 9:57:22 AM, is triggered by pull requests and pushes to specific branches (`prestaging`, `story/ci_integration`, `others/ci_experiment`).

The pipeline consists of several jobs:

* **`setup`**: This job sets up the environment, including checking out the code, setting up Dart, Melos, Node.js, and Flutter (version 3.29.2), and installing necessary Perl modules.  It uses reusable steps defined in `x-common-setup`.  This job also utilizes several actions from freshactions.


* **`format_check`**: Checks code formatting using `melos run format_ci`.

* **`analyze`**: Runs code analysis using `melos run analyze`.

* **`unit_test`**: Runs unit tests using `melos unit_test` after starting a Mockoon server (likely for mocking API calls) via a script located at `.github/scripts/start_mackoon_server.sh`.  The script's execution permissions are explicitly set.

* **`coverage`**: Generates and reports code coverage using `melos combine_coverage`, `melos exclude_autogeneration_from_coverage`, and `melos exclude_ui_from_coverage`. It uses the `freshactions/github-actions-report-lcov` action to upload the coverage report (minimum coverage set to 73%) and post a comment on the pull request.

The workflow heavily relies on `melos`, a tool for managing multi-package repositories.  The use of reusable steps (`x-common-setup`) promotes consistency and reduces redundancy.  All jobs except `setup` depend on the `setup` job, indicating a sequential execution flow.  There is also consistent use of `freshactions`, suggesting a reliance on custom actions developed and maintained within the Freshworks organization.

The code changes primarily involve updates to the Freshservice mobile application's data handling and feature flags.  Several files were modified between 10:29 AM and 10:36 AM on April 23, 2025.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/domain/provider/feature_flag_provider.dart`: This file defines an abstract interface `FeatureFlagProvider` and an enum `FeatureFlag` listing various feature flags such as `requesterProfile`, `isParallelApprovalEnabled`, and others. This is the initial definition of the feature flags.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/lib/src/pigeon/host/data/generated/fs_module_data_host_api.g.dart`: This file, generated by the Pigeon code generation tool, contains Dart code for inter-process communication (IPC).  Multiple revisions of this file exist in the log, reflecting iterative changes to the `PGFeatureFlag` enum. Initially,  `isDelegateApprovalsEnabled` was absent; subsequent revisions added it. This suggests the addition of a new feature flag related to delegate approvals.  The file also defines data structures for user information (`PGUser`, `PGFSModuleInitData`) and data handling methods (`getInitData`, `getFreshIdServiceInfo`, methods to interact with an in-memory store, etc.).


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/lib/src/pigeon/host/data/helper/pg_feature_flag_mapper.dart`: This file provides a mapper between the `FeatureFlag` enum in the `common_business` library and the `PGFeatureFlag` enum used for IPC. This ensures consistency between the application's internal feature flag representation and the one used for communication with the native platform.  The updates here mirror the changes in `fs_module_data_host_api.g.dart`, specifically the addition of `isDelegateApprovalsEnabled`.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/pigeon/fs_module_data_host_api.dart`: This file defines the Pigeon API for the native platform.  The `PGFeatureFlag` enum in this file also reflects the addition of `isDelegateApprovalsEnabled` in later revisions. This file shows the definition of the inter-process communication interface, which is used to communicate between the Flutter app and the native platform. It includes several methods for getting and setting data, and also interacting with feature flags.


The repeated updates to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/lib/src/pigeon/host/data/generated/fs_module_data_host_api.g.dart` are consistent with the automatic code generation nature of Pigeon, adapting to changes in the related API definition file.  The primary pattern is the evolution of the `PGFeatureFlag` enum, adding support for a new `isDelegateApprovalsEnabled` feature.
