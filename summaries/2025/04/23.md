# Activity Summary for 4/23/2025

## 10:06:28 AM
The provided log shows a GitHub workflow file (`pr_checks.yaml`) defining a CI/CD pipeline for a Flutter mobile application.  The workflow, updated on April 23, 2025, at 9:57:22 AM, is triggered by pull requests and pushes to specific branches (`prestaging`, `story/ci_integration`, `others/ci_experiment`).

The pipeline consists of several jobs:

* **`setup`**: This job sets up the environment, including checking out the code, setting up Dart, Melos, Node.js, and Flutter (version 3.29.2), and installing necessary Perl modules.  It uses reusable steps defined in `x-common-setup`.  This job also utilizes several actions from freshactions.


* **`format_check`**: Checks code formatting using `melos run format_ci`.

* **`analyze`**: Runs code analysis using `melos run analyze`.

* **`unit_test`**: Runs unit tests using `melos unit_test` after starting a Mockoon server (likely for mocking API calls) via a script located at `.github/scripts/start_mackoon_server.sh`.  The script's execution permissions are explicitly set.

* **`coverage`**: Generates and reports code coverage using `melos combine_coverage`, `melos exclude_autogeneration_from_coverage`, and `melos exclude_ui_from_coverage`. It uses the `freshactions/github-actions-report-lcov` action to upload the coverage report (minimum coverage set to 73%) and post a comment on the pull request.

The workflow heavily relies on `melos`, a tool for managing multi-package repositories.  The use of reusable steps (`x-common-setup`) promotes consistency and reduces redundancy.  All jobs except `setup` depend on the `setup` job, indicating a sequential execution flow.  There is also consistent use of `freshactions`, suggesting a reliance on custom actions developed and maintained within the Freshworks organization.


## 11:06:30 AM
The code changes primarily involve updates to the Freshservice mobile application's data handling and feature flags.  Several files were modified between 10:29 AM and 10:36 AM on April 23, 2025.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/domain/provider/feature_flag_provider.dart`: This file defines an abstract interface `FeatureFlagProvider` and an enum `FeatureFlag` listing various feature flags such as `requesterProfile`, `isParallelApprovalEnabled`, and others. This is the initial definition of the feature flags.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/lib/src/pigeon/host/data/generated/fs_module_data_host_api.g.dart`: This file, generated by the Pigeon code generation tool, contains Dart code for inter-process communication (IPC).  Multiple revisions of this file exist in the log, reflecting iterative changes to the `PGFeatureFlag` enum. Initially,  `isDelegateApprovalsEnabled` was absent; subsequent revisions added it. This suggests the addition of a new feature flag related to delegate approvals.  The file also defines data structures for user information (`PGUser`, `PGFSModuleInitData`) and data handling methods (`getInitData`, `getFreshIdServiceInfo`, methods to interact with an in-memory store, etc.).


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/lib/src/pigeon/host/data/helper/pg_feature_flag_mapper.dart`: This file provides a mapper between the `FeatureFlag` enum in the `common_business` library and the `PGFeatureFlag` enum used for IPC. This ensures consistency between the application's internal feature flag representation and the one used for communication with the native platform.  The updates here mirror the changes in `fs_module_data_host_api.g.dart`, specifically the addition of `isDelegateApprovalsEnabled`.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/pigeon/fs_module_data_host_api.dart`: This file defines the Pigeon API for the native platform.  The `PGFeatureFlag` enum in this file also reflects the addition of `isDelegateApprovalsEnabled` in later revisions. This file shows the definition of the inter-process communication interface, which is used to communicate between the Flutter app and the native platform. It includes several methods for getting and setting data, and also interacting with feature flags.


The repeated updates to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/lib/src/pigeon/host/data/generated/fs_module_data_host_api.g.dart` are consistent with the automatic code generation nature of Pigeon, adapting to changes in the related API definition file.  The primary pattern is the evolution of the `PGFeatureFlag` enum, adding support for a new `isDelegateApprovalsEnabled` feature.


## 12:06:29 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the development and integration of an `FSBanner` widget within a Flutter application.  The `FSBanner` component, initially named `ApprovalDelegateBanner`, underwent several revisions.  The core functionality—a banner with a title, subtitle, leading widget, and tap action—remained consistent.  Styling updates involved color adjustments based on dark/light theme and consistent use of  `Color` constants.

The `fs_banner.dart` file underwent multiple edits between 11:34 AM and 11:56 AM, with the class name changing from `ApprovalDelegateBanner` to `FSBanner`. The core structure of the banner remained the same across the edits.

Around 11:49 AM, the `CoreComponentElements` enum in  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/core/model/core_component_elements.dart` was updated to include `fsBanner`, indicating the component's addition to the UI catalog.  Simultaneously, a `FSBannerCatalogScreen` was created to showcase the banner within this catalog.

Between 11:49 AM and 12:00 PM, the `FSBannerCatalogScreen` file underwent multiple revisions, seemingly related to minor code formatting or import adjustments. A significant change at 11:53 AM moved the `FSBanner` import from `fs_lib` to `fs_ui_catalog_app`, suggesting a refactoring effort to better organize the codebase.

Finally, at 11:55 AM, the `FSBanner` widget's source code was moved to  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/components/banner/fs_banner.dart`, solidifying this component as part of a `core_ui` library, and the `FSBannerCatalogScreen` file was updated to reflect this change by importing from `core_ui` rather than `fs_lib` by 12:00 PM. The `core_ui.dart` file was also updated at 11:56 AM to include the new banner component.  These final changes represent the most significant refactoring and code relocation.


## 1:12:46 PM
The log shows development of a Flutter `FSBanner` component and its usage within a catalog screen.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/core/view/components/fs_banner_catalog_screen.dart`**: This file showcases the `FSBanner` component.  Initially (4/23/2025, 12:14:00 PM), it displayed a simple `FSBanner` without a message or action.  Later (4/23/2025, 12:14:47 PM), a sample message and an "onManage" callback were added, showing a snackbar on tap.  Finally (4/23/2025, 12:57:44 PM and 1:02:58 PM) this file was updated to show two banners, one with a default message and action, and another with a custom message and action and finally a more elaborate example using `TextSpan`.


**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/components/banner/fs_banner.dart`**: This file contains the `FSBanner` widget's implementation.  It underwent significant changes between 12:35:22 PM and 12:45:01 PM.  The initial version (12:35:22 PM)  was a basic banner with a message and an "onManage" callback.  Subsequent updates (12:36:11 PM - 12:37:55 PM) refined the styling, using  `ShapeDecoration`, `RoundedRectangleBorder`, and  `BorderSide` for visual enhancements.  The styling leveraged theme properties. The color values are hardcoded initially, later replaced with references to a theme's color scheme (using `context.theme.fsColorScheme`). The hardcoded padding values were replaced by `space16` which implies use of a theme-aware spacing system. Multiple updates involved minor code cleanup and adjustments. The `message` parameter changed from a `String` to a `TextSpan` (12:39:14 PM)  allowing for richer text formatting. The `onManage` callback was renamed to `onClick` (12:39:38 PM).  Finally, an `actionText` parameter was added (12:43:56 PM), allowing for customization of the button text.  The final version uses `FSPlainButton` instead of a `TextButton` and conditionally renders the button based on `onClick` and `actionText` (12:53:40 PM and 12:57:33 PM)

The most significant changes to `fs_banner.dart` occurred within a short period (12:36:11 PM to 12:45:01 PM), focusing on styling, theme integration, and parameter adjustments. The use of `TextSpan` provides flexibility in formatting the banner's message.  The evolution of `fs_banner.dart` demonstrates iterative development, improving the component's flexibility, visual appeal, and theme integration. The final change at 12:57:33 PM was a minor formatting update only.
