# Activity Summary for 4/10/2025

## 3:52:30 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a markdown file detailing how to integrate a Flutter module (`fsmodule`) and a `pigeon` module into a Freshservice Android application.  The file content remained consistent across all revisions, indicating no changes to the instructions themselves.  The only variation is in the timestamps, showing updates at 4/10/2025, 3:47:34 PM, 3:49:55 PM, 3:50:58 PM, and 3:51:04 PM. These timestamps suggest minor, possibly automated, saves or updates to the document within a short time frame, rather than substantive content changes. The document describes a process for building a release `.aar` file from the `fsmodule`, publishing the `pigeon` module locally, and integrating both into the Android app, using Maven repositories for dependency management.  The `fsmodule` uses build number 5.1, while the `pigeon` module's version is 5.0.0 in the provided examples.  The instructions emphasize switching the Android signing configuration to `debug` for testing and reverting to `release` for production builds.
