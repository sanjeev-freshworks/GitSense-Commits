# Activity Summary for 4/12/2025

## 7:27:47 PM
The log shows development activity on a Spring Boot based backend application named `freshoverflow`.  The primary focus appears to be on question and answer functionality, with additional features for reactions and tags.

**AnswerController.java (4/12/2025, 6:27:06 PM):** This file was initially committed and contains REST controllers for managing answers and their reactions.  It uses Spring annotations (`@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@PathVariable`, `@RequestBody`, `@CrossOrigin`) to handle HTTP requests.  The controller interacts with `AnswerService` and `ReactionService` to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and manage reactions to answers.

**pom.xml (4/12/2025, 6:28:08 PM & 4/12/2025, 6:28:16 PM):** The `pom.xml` file, which is the project's Maven configuration file, was updated twice, but the changes between these commits are identical (no changes were made in the second commit to this file). The project uses Spring Boot starter dependencies for web, data JPA, and actuator.  The H2 database is included for runtime, and Spring Boot security is commented out.  Java version 11 is specified.

**TagService.java (4/12/2025, 6:50:40 PM & 4/12/2025, 6:50:46 PM):** This file shows a `TagService` with methods to get all tags and save a tag.  The two commits show no differences. The `getAllTags()` method is commented out initially then remains commented out in the second commit.

**QuestionController.java (4/12/2025, 6:52:22 PM - 4/12/2025, 6:54:38 PM):** This file underwent multiple revisions between 6:52:22 PM and 6:54:38 PM.  Initially, it contained REST controllers for managing questions. It included methods to create, retrieve, update questions, and retrieve all questions.  The `/tags` endpoint was initially commented out, then modified several times to return a hardcoded list of `String` tags (Android, iOS, Flutter, Spring Boot, Unreal Engine, Dev Ops, AI & ML) instead of using the `TagService`. This suggests a change in design or a temporary workaround.  The repeated commits show iterative refinement of the hardcoded tag list.


**TagController.java (4/12/2025, 6:59:20 PM):** This file contains a REST controller for creating tags, using the `TagService` to persist them.

In summary, the codebase focuses on building a Q&A platform. The majority of the changes were made to the `QuestionController`, evolving how tags are handled, initially intending to leverage a `TagService`, then resorting to a hardcoded list for a simpler implementation.  The other files show the basic infrastructure for the application.  The lack of change between some commits to TagService and pom.xml suggests potential minor errors in the log.
