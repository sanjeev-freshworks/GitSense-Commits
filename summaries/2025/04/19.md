# Activity Summary for 4/19/2025

## 12:52:47 PM
The log shows two entries for the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/fs_banner.dart`.  Both entries contain identical code, representing a `ApprovalDelegateBanner` widget in Flutter. This widget is a banner displaying a title, subtitle, and leading icon.  The banner's appearance adapts to dark and light themes. The code defines a default icon (`_DefaultBannerIcon`) if no leading widget is provided. The two entries are separated by only one minute (9:49:51 AM and 9:50:22 AM), suggesting a possible accidental double save or a minor, unrecorded change. No substantive code modifications occurred between these timestamps.
