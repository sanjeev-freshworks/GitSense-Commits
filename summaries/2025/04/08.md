# Activity Summary for 4/8/2025

## 1:51:04 PM
The log shows a single file, `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, undergoing multiple revisions between 1:17 PM and 1:31 PM on April 8th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: intercepting and modifying HTTP requests and responses related to a Freshservice instance.

The changes primarily involve refining the logic within the `response` method of the `InterceptFreshservice` class.  Several functions within `response` intercept requests based on URL patterns:

* `/reply-suggestion`: Modifies the response to set `"success"` to `False`. This change is consistently present and remains largely unchanged.
* `/bootstrap/me`:  Consistently sets the response status code to 404 (Not Found).
* `api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items`: This URL is the focus of significant changes.  Multiple functions (`changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, `changeResponseDirectly`) target this endpoint. Initially,  `changeAdditionalItems` modified the name of a service item, and `updateAdditionalItems` duplicated and modified `display_id` values. Later revisions simplify this by directly replacing the entire response body with  `{"hello":"hi"}`  within `changeResponseDirectly`.


The `changeGenAI` function is incrementally developed. It starts without a filter, then filters for "expand", then adds "rephrase" and "tone" to the filter. This function sets the response status code to 404.

The `changeRTS` function receives a filter ("rts" then refined to "rts-message") to intercept requests related to Real-Time Suggestions and sets the response status code to 404.  The commented-out calls to `changeFreddyReplySuggestion`, `changeAdditionalItems`, and `updateAdditionalItems` and `changeRTS` suggest experimentation and iterative refinement of the script.

The `websocket_message` method consistently manipulates WebSocket messages, replacing the `"msg"` field with an error indicating no instructions were found.  This part of the code remains stable across all revisions.  The overall pattern shows a progression towards a more streamlined and focused approach for intercepting and manipulating Freshservice API responses.


## 3:51:02 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py` file between 3:23:46 PM and 3:27:43 PM on April 8th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve modifying the `response` method within the `InterceptFreshservice` class. This method intercepts HTTP responses from a Freshservice API and alters them.

Specifically, several functions within the `response` method target different API endpoints:

* **`/reply-suggestion`:** Sets the "success" field to `False` in the JSON response.
* **Endpoints containing "expand", "rephrase", or "tone":** Sets the HTTP status code to 404 (Not Found).
* **`api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items`:** This endpoint undergoes the most significant changes across revisions.  Initially, it modifies the `"name"` field of the first service item to "Sanjeev Kumar". Later revisions show experimentation: one version duplicates the `service_items` list and increments `display_id` values; another completely overwrites the response with `{"hello": "hi"}`.


The `websocket_message` method intercepts and modifies websocket messages, specifically replacing the "msg" field with an error indicating no instructions were found.

The minor revisions between 3:27:14 PM and 3:27:43 PM do not introduce any new functionality but appear to be focused on experimenting with different response manipulations for the `api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items` endpoint, ultimately settling on replacing the entire response with a simple test JSON object.  The commented-out code suggests various approaches were tried before arriving at the final version.  There is no substantial change in the `request` method across revisions.  The overall pattern is iterative development and experimentation with different ways to intercept and modify Freshservice API responses.


## 4:51:04 PM
The log shows multiple edits to the `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py` file between 4:04 PM and 4:31 PM on April 8th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve modifying the `response` method within the `InterceptFreshservice` class. This method intercepts and alters HTTP responses from a Freshservice API.

The modifications consistently target specific API endpoints or URLs within Freshservice.  These include endpoints related to:

* **Reply suggestions:**  `/reply-suggestion` - The `success` field in the response is set to `False`.
* **GenAI related endpoints:** containing "expand", "rephrase", or "tone" in the URL - The response status code is set to 404 (Not Found).
* **Real-time messaging (RTS):**  `"rts-message"` - The response status code is set to 404.
* **Bootstrap User Data:** `/bootstrap/me` - The response status code is set to 404.
* **Additional Items:** `"api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items"` - This endpoint undergoes the most significant changes.  Several different modifications are attempted across the edits, including changing the name of a service item to "Sanjeev Kumar",  duplicating the `service_items` list and incrementing `display_id` values, and finally completely replacing the response with  `{"hello": "hi"}`.

The `request` method also includes a function `updateAdditionalItems` that modifies the page number in queries to the  `"api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items"` endpoint if the page is 2, changing it to 5.

The `websocket_message` method intercepts and modifies WebSocket messages, specifically replacing the "msg" field with an error message indicating "no instructions found".

There's no clear pattern to the multiple edits, each appearing to be an independent attempt at manipulating the response from the `/additional-items` endpoint. The final version uses the `changeResponseDirectly` function which overwrites the response completely, suggesting a final decision on how to handle this specific endpoint.  The commented-out code within the `response` function indicates experimentation and iterative refinement.
