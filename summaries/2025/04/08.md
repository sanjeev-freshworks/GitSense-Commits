# Activity Summary for 4/8/2025

The log shows a single file, `/Users/skumar14/PersonalLearning/MitmProxyScripts/freshservice_mitm.py`, undergoing multiple revisions between 1:17 PM and 1:31 PM on April 8th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: intercepting and modifying HTTP requests and responses related to a Freshservice instance.

The changes primarily involve refining the logic within the `response` method of the `InterceptFreshservice` class.  Several functions within `response` intercept requests based on URL patterns:

* `/reply-suggestion`: Modifies the response to set `"success"` to `False`. This change is consistently present and remains largely unchanged.
* `/bootstrap/me`:  Consistently sets the response status code to 404 (Not Found).
* `api/_/catalog/service-items/18/additional-items`: This URL is the focus of significant changes.  Multiple functions (`changeAdditionalItems`, `updateAdditionalItems`, `changeResponseDirectly`) target this endpoint. Initially,  `changeAdditionalItems` modified the name of a service item, and `updateAdditionalItems` duplicated and modified `display_id` values. Later revisions simplify this by directly replacing the entire response body with  `{"hello":"hi"}`  within `changeResponseDirectly`.


The `changeGenAI` function is incrementally developed. It starts without a filter, then filters for "expand", then adds "rephrase" and "tone" to the filter. This function sets the response status code to 404.

The `changeRTS` function receives a filter ("rts" then refined to "rts-message") to intercept requests related to Real-Time Suggestions and sets the response status code to 404.  The commented-out calls to `changeFreddyReplySuggestion`, `changeAdditionalItems`, and `updateAdditionalItems` and `changeRTS` suggest experimentation and iterative refinement of the script.

The `websocket_message` method consistently manipulates WebSocket messages, replacing the `"msg"` field with an error indicating no instructions were found.  This part of the code remains stable across all revisions.  The overall pattern shows a progression towards a more streamlined and focused approach for intercepting and manipulating Freshservice API responses.
