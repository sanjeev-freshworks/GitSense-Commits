# Activity Summary for 9/9/2025

## 10:17:10 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/components/image/fs_network_image.dart` between 10:05:58 AM and 10:11:23 AM on September 9, 2025.  These changes focus on improving the robustness of network image loading, particularly handling errors related to Flutter engine switching.

The initial version (10:05:58 AM) implemented basic retry logic for image loading errors.  Subsequent commits added several key features:

* **Unique Keys for Retries (10:06:15 AM):**  A unique key was added to the `Image.network` widget to force a rebuild on each retry, ensuring that the widget properly reflects the retry status.

* **Separate Error Handling (10:06:29 AM):** The error handling was refactored to introduce a dedicated `_handleImageError` function, making the code more organized and readable.  This commit also included the addition of `_lastAttemptedUrl` and `_isRetrying` variables to better manage the retry state.  It introduced a delay before retries and  `_clearImageCache` function to clear image cache for url, to clear the image cache specifically for the failed URL in case of engine-related errors.


* **Engine Error Detection and Aggressive Recovery (10:09:34 AM & 10:09:52 AM):**  The code was enhanced to detect engine-related errors (`_isEngineRelatedError`) and implement more aggressive recovery mechanisms. This included clearing the entire image cache (`imageCache.clear(); imageCache.clearLiveImages();`) for engine errors to ensure a complete refresh, and increasing the retry delay for engine errors.

* **Fallback Loader Implementation (10:10:36 AM & 10:10:52 AM):** A fallback image loading mechanism (`_buildFallbackImage` and `_createImageProvider`) was introduced.  This fallback uses a modified URL with a cache-busting parameter (`_cb`) to force a fresh image load.  The fallback is triggered if an engine-related error occurs after at least one retry.  A `_useFallbackLoader` boolean variable is introduced to toggle between the regular loader and the fallback loader.

* **Increased Max Retries (10:11:04 AM & 10:11:23 AM):** The maximum number of retries was increased from 2 to 3 to accommodate the more aggressive retry strategy for engine errors.


The changes follow a pattern of iterative improvement to handle image loading failures, especially those related to Flutter engine switching issues. The logging throughout the code (`FSLogger`) helps in debugging and monitoring the image loading process.  The final version incorporates a more sophisticated error handling and recovery system, leveraging cache clearing and a fallback loader to increase the likelihood of successful image loading under adverse conditions.  A test file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/test/components/image/fs_network_image_test.dart` was updated to  include tests for error handling.  The change at 10:16:52 AM modifies a different file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/view/components/article_detail_info.dart`, and is unrelated to the image loading improvements.
