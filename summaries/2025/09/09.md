# Activity Summary for 9/9/2025

## 10:17:10 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/components/image/fs_network_image.dart` between 10:05:58 AM and 10:11:23 AM on September 9, 2025.  These changes focus on improving the robustness of network image loading, particularly handling errors related to Flutter engine switching.

The initial version (10:05:58 AM) implemented basic retry logic for image loading errors.  Subsequent commits added several key features:

* **Unique Keys for Retries (10:06:15 AM):**  A unique key was added to the `Image.network` widget to force a rebuild on each retry, ensuring that the widget properly reflects the retry status.

* **Separate Error Handling (10:06:29 AM):** The error handling was refactored to introduce a dedicated `_handleImageError` function, making the code more organized and readable.  This commit also included the addition of `_lastAttemptedUrl` and `_isRetrying` variables to better manage the retry state.  It introduced a delay before retries and  `_clearImageCache` function to clear image cache for url, to clear the image cache specifically for the failed URL in case of engine-related errors.


* **Engine Error Detection and Aggressive Recovery (10:09:34 AM & 10:09:52 AM):**  The code was enhanced to detect engine-related errors (`_isEngineRelatedError`) and implement more aggressive recovery mechanisms. This included clearing the entire image cache (`imageCache.clear(); imageCache.clearLiveImages();`) for engine errors to ensure a complete refresh, and increasing the retry delay for engine errors.

* **Fallback Loader Implementation (10:10:36 AM & 10:10:52 AM):** A fallback image loading mechanism (`_buildFallbackImage` and `_createImageProvider`) was introduced.  This fallback uses a modified URL with a cache-busting parameter (`_cb`) to force a fresh image load.  The fallback is triggered if an engine-related error occurs after at least one retry.  A `_useFallbackLoader` boolean variable is introduced to toggle between the regular loader and the fallback loader.

* **Increased Max Retries (10:11:04 AM & 10:11:23 AM):** The maximum number of retries was increased from 2 to 3 to accommodate the more aggressive retry strategy for engine errors.


The changes follow a pattern of iterative improvement to handle image loading failures, especially those related to Flutter engine switching issues. The logging throughout the code (`FSLogger`) helps in debugging and monitoring the image loading process.  The final version incorporates a more sophisticated error handling and recovery system, leveraging cache clearing and a fallback loader to increase the likelihood of successful image loading under adverse conditions.  A test file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/test/components/image/fs_network_image_test.dart` was updated to  include tests for error handling.  The change at 10:16:52 AM modifies a different file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/view/components/article_detail_info.dart`, and is unrelated to the image loading improvements.


## 11:17:16 AM
The log shows modifications to two Dart files: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/components/image/fs_network_image.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/view/components/article_detail_info.dart`.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/components/image/fs_network_image.dart`**: This file underwent several revisions between 10:17 AM and 10:37 AM on September 9th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes was to improve the robustness of network image loading, particularly handling errors related to Flutter engine switching and memory pressure.  The updates include:

* **Increased Retry Logic:** The `maxRetries` parameter was initially increased from 2 to 3 to better handle engine switching. Later it was reverted back to 2.
* **Fallback Loader:** An alternative image loading mechanism (`_buildFallbackImage`) was introduced to mitigate consistent failures with `Image.network`. This fallback uses a different image provider and attempts to bypass the image cache.
* **Cache Management:**  The code was enhanced to clear the entire image cache (`imageCache.clear(); imageCache.clearLiveImages();`) when persistent engine errors occurred, forcing a complete refresh. For other errors, only the specific image from the cache is evicted.
* **Signed URL Handling:** A check was added to identify signed URLs (e.g., from AWS S3 or CloudFront). Cache-busting parameters are not added to signed URLs to avoid invalidating the signature.
* **Retry Delay:**  Retry delays were implemented and adjusted; longer delays (1000ms) were used for engine errors, and shorter delays (100ms) for other retryable errors.
* **Simplified Retry Logic:** The final revision significantly simplified the retry logic, removing the complex error handling and fallback mechanism and only retaining retry logic for specific errors.


**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/view/components/article_detail_info.dart`**: This file was modified between 10:32 AM and 10:36 AM on September 9th, 2025. The changes primarily involved refinements to the UI component displaying article information.  Specific changes include:

* **Image Handling:**  The `_buildImage` function, responsible for rendering workspace logos, was modified to use the `FsNetworkImage` component.  This likely improves consistency in image loading and error handling across the application.
* **Placeholder Improvements:** The placeholder for the workspace logo image was simplified.
* **Null Safety:** A null check was added to `articleInfoUIModel.workspace!.logo` in `_buildWorkspace` to prevent null pointer exceptions.
* **Logging:**  A log statement (`FSLogger.logWithTag("siderfighter", "_buildImage(): Url = $url");`) was added to `_buildImage` for debugging purposes.

In summary, the changes across both files focus on enhancing the reliability and performance of image loading and displaying within the application, particularly addressing issues related to the Flutter engine and improving the handling of various error conditions.  The use of the `FSLogger` for logging throughout suggests a focus on improving debugging and monitoring capabilities.  The consistent use of `space20`, `space32`, `space4`, and `space8` suggests a defined spacing convention within the UI code.
