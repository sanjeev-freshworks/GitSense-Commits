# Activity Summary for 9/17/2025

## 12:17:14 AM
The log shows development of `JourneySimpleTaskDetailScreen` and `JourneySimpleTaskDetailScreenArgs` classes within a Flutter project.

The `journey_simple_task_detail_screen.dart` file initially defines an empty class, then adds a `StatelessWidget` extending `JourneySimpleTaskDetailScreen` with a basic `build` method. Later, it imports necessary packages and includes `JourneySimpleTaskDetailScreenArgs` as a parameter in its constructor. Finally, a `const` constructor is added using `super.key`.

The `journey_simple_task_detail_screen_args.dart` file iteratively refines the  `JourneySimpleTaskDetailScreenArgs` class.  Initially, it's incomplete.  Subsequent changes add `name` and `id` fields,  and eventually a `const` constructor with `required` parameters for  `name` and `id`.

Significant changes occurred around 4:32 PM and 8:55 PM on 9/16/2025. The 4:32 PM timeframe shows the iterative development of the `JourneySimpleTaskDetailScreenArgs` class.  The 8:55 PM change adds the `const` constructor to `JourneySimpleTaskDetailScreen` and the `super.key` parameter.

The overall pattern reveals a step-by-step development process, gradually fleshing out the classes' functionality and implementing the required parameters and constructors.  The changes demonstrate a common development pattern of iterative refinement and the addition of important constructor parameters.

The log shows multiple updates to two files: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/journey/journey.md` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/freshservice_data.json`.

The `journey.md` file, documenting Journey APIs, underwent several revisions between 11:06 AM and 11:16 AM on September 17th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve adjustments to the relative file paths within the Markdown document that point to JSON response bodies. Specifically, paths to response files for "Get Journey Form Fields", "Get Journey Task Detail", "Get Journey Data", "Update Journey Task - Simple Task", and "Update Journey Task - Form" were shortened from `../../../../response/...` to `../../../response/...` in several commits, suggesting a reorganization of the response files' directory structure.


The `freshservice_data.json` file, which appears to contain configuration data for a Freshservice mock API, was modified three times between 11:08 AM and 11:11 AM on the same day.  The changes are not explicitly shown, but the repeated timestamps and file path indicate that minor alterations likely occurred during this period, possibly relating to the addition or modification of UUIDs, route details within the "folders" array.  The structure suggests a hierarchical organization of API routes categorized by features (Ticket, Scenario Automation, Common, ToDo, etc.). The large size of the JSON suggests a complex data model.
