# Activity Summary for 9/18/2025

## 2:44:07 AM
The log shows multiple updates to files within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib` directory, primarily focusing on the `journey_activity_list` and `task_detail` features.  The most significant changes occur between 9:53 PM and 11:12 PM.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/journey_activity_list/view/helper/journey_activity_list_ui_helper.dart` underwent several revisions. Initially, the `_navigateToSimpleTaskDetail` function lacked parameters. Subsequent changes added a `journeyActivity` parameter, and further modifications integrated `journeyActivity` data (specifically `journeyActivity.title`, `journeyActivity.displayId`, `journeyActivity.journeyDisplayId`, and finally `journeyActivity.status`) into the  `JourneySimpleTaskDetailScreenRoute`.  The final revision also adds a logging statement using `FSLogger`.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/journey_activity_list/presentation/model/navigation/journey_activity_list_navigation_state.dart` was modified to add the `isPastItem` field to `JourneyActivityListNavigationState.navigateToSimpleTaskDetail` around 10:00 PM, and then removed again later. This suggests an initial attempt to handle past items differently in navigation which was subsequently reverted.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/journey_activity_list/presentation/bloc/journey_activity_list_bloc.dart`  received updates to the `_onActivitySelected` function around 10:00 PM and 10:38 PM. These changes involved logging using `FSLogger` and passing the `isPastItem` state to the navigation state.  The `isPastItem` parameter was later removed from the navigation state.

The files related to the `journey_task_detail` UI module (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail`) show a series of changes between 10:42 PM and 10:49 PM, primarily focused on registering the `JourneyTaskDetailUIMapper` and `JourneyTaskDetailBloc` within the dependency injection system (`fsDIComponent`). The `JourneyTaskDetailBloc` registration especially evolves from a basic registration to one that includes parameters, then arguments, showing the progressive refinement of its dependency injection setup.  The `journey_task_detail_ui_mapper` file was modified to improve the mapping and formatting of date and time values for a cleaner UI representation.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/data/model/response/journey_task_detail.dart` and related files (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote`) saw changes between 11:02 PM and 11:12 PM involving the addition of `taskableDisplayId` to the `JourneyTaskDetail` model and its associated API model and mapper, reflecting a change to how journey IDs are handled.

The addition of  `FSLogger` statements in multiple files indicates a focus on improving logging capabilities for debugging and monitoring purposes.  A recurring pattern is the iterative refinement of the `JourneySimpleTaskDetailScreenRoute` and its associated components to handle more data and enhance navigation logic, likely to support improved user experience.


## 1:15:26 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail/view/journey_simple_task_detail_screen_root.dart` between 11:37 AM and 12:30 PM on September 18, 2025.  These changes primarily focus on refining the `AppBar` within the `JourneySimpleTaskDetailScreenRoot` widget.

Initially, the AppBar had a `PreferredSize` with a height of 48.  Subsequent commits adjusted this height multiple times (48, 0, 20, 30, 48, 40, 56), ultimately settling on a dynamic height based on the presence of `widget.args.taskDescription` and `widget.args.status`.  If both are present, the height is `space56`; otherwise, it's `space24` if only `widget.args.status` is present and `space0` if both are null.  The `spaceXX` values suggest the use of a spacing constant.

The `AppBar`'s title was also modified.  It started as a simple `Text` widget displaying `widget.args.taskName`, then evolved into a `Column` to accommodate both the task name and description (`widget.args.taskDescription`) if available.


A conditional rendering was introduced for the `AppBar`'s bottom section, showing a `Column` containing the task description, status (`_formStatusWidget`), and a `Divider` only if either the description or status is not null. The  `_formStatusWidget` displays different tags (FSTag.warningTag or FSTag.errorTag) based on the `JourneyActivityStatus`.


The imports remain consistent throughout the revisions, indicating no changes to external dependencies.  There were no changes to the `_buildBody` method.

A `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/route/journey_lib_routes_builder.dart` file was also modified at 12:08 PM and 12:19 PM and 12:20 PM and 12:27 PM and 12:29PM,  showing the addition of a route for `JourneySimpleTaskDetailScreenRoute`.  A significant change here was uncommenting the `taskDescription` and `status` in the `JourneySimpleTaskDetailScreenArgs` constructor,  making the app bar dynamically sized depending on whether description and status are provided.

Finally,  a new file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail/presentation/helper/mapper/journey_task_detail_ui_mapper.dart` appears in the log with two revisions at 1:01 PM, seemingly introducing a mapper for UI model transformations.  The changes involve minor adjustments within the mapper, updating how data is handled in certain functions, mainly fixing the parameter passed to `_mapJourneyDataValue` function to ensure `fieldLabel` and `fieldValue` are passed correctly.
