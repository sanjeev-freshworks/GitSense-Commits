# Activity Summary for 9/1/2025

## 11:59:06 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two Dart files: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/mapper/folder_info_ui_model_mapper.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/folder_detail_screen.dart`.

The `folder_info_ui_model_mapper.dart` file underwent numerous revisions between 11:19 AM and 11:58 AM on September 1st, 2025.  These revisions primarily focused on refining the  `_getWorkspaceNameFromWorkspaceId` function. Initially, this function was incomplete or incorrectly implemented, with multiple attempts to define its input parameters and return value appropriately. The final version takes a `BootstrapAccount?` and `int` (workspaceId) as parameters and returns a String, or an empty String if the workspace is not found.  The rest of the file remained largely unchanged.

The `folder_detail_screen.dart` file was modified twice, at 11:28 AM and then again between 11:54 AM and 11:54 AM on September 1st, 2025. The  significant change was the removal of a complex navigation logic within the `_listenState` function  that handled folder-to-folder navigation using `replace` method.  This was simplified to use only the `push` method for navigation.  The changes also removed logging statements using `FSLogger`.
