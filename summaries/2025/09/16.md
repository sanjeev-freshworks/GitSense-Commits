# Activity Summary for 9/16/2025

## 4:25:02 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/ui/task_detail/presentation/bloc/journey_task_detail_bloc_test.dart` file and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail/presentation/bloc/journey_task_detail_bloc.dart` file between 3:47 PM and 4:09 PM on September 16, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on unit testing a `JourneyTaskDetailBloc` using the `bloc_test` package.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/ui/task_detail/presentation/bloc/journey_task_detail_bloc_test.dart` file underwent several revisions.  Early versions contained numerous `blocTest` cases covering different events (`ViewCreated`, `MarkAsDoneClicked`, `JourneyDataViewMoreClicked`).  These tests extensively use mock objects (`mockito`) and fixtures to simulate various scenarios, including success and failure cases for loading task details and journey data, and handling the "mark as done" action.  Later revisions simplified the test structure, focusing on individual events and improving test clarity and organization.  The `act` section of the `blocTest` for `MarkAsDoneClicked` was modified to include an `await` statement to ensure the `ViewCreated` event completes before proceeding. The `skip` parameter was added to some tests to manage state transitions more effectively.  Finally, the `FSAnalytics` mock was removed as a dependency in the `JourneyTaskDetailBloc` constructor, resulting in a simplification of the test setup.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail/presentation/bloc/journey_task_detail_bloc.dart` file was also modified. The most significant change involved removing the `FSAnalytics` dependency from the `JourneyTaskDetailBloc` constructor and eliminating associated analytics tracking calls within the event handlers.  This reduces coupling and simplifies the bloc's logic.  Minor formatting changes and adjustments to parameter passing within the `_onViewCreated` method are also observed across different revisions.  The constructor was modified to use positional parameters rather than named parameters.

In summary, the changes reflect a refinement of the unit tests for the `JourneyTaskDetailBloc` and a decoupling of the bloc from the `FSAnalytics` dependency. The changes improved the test design and streamlined the bloc's code.
