# Activity Summary for 9/10/2025

## 12:55:50 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/response/journey_task_detail_api_model_mapper.dart`.  The file contains Dart code defining several extension methods for mapping API models (`JourneyTaskDetailApiModel`, `JourneyTaskApiModel`, `AgentApiModel`, `AdditionalDataApiModel`, `ServiceItemsApiModel`, `ServiceItemFieldsApiModel`) to corresponding data models (`JourneyTaskDetail`, `Agent`, `AdditionalData`, `ServiceItems`, `ServiceItemFields`).

The code consistently uses null-aware operators (`??`) to provide default values for optional fields during the mapping process.  The `customFields` are handled using `map` to ensure proper type conversion.  

There are no substantive changes to the code across the four revisions;  all versions are functionally identical. The timestamps indicate that the edits occurred between 10:55 AM and 11:49 AM on September 10th, 2025.  The repeated "what is the form field in my task? the journey data ap" text at the end of some revisions suggests this might be a comment or note unrelated to the code itself, perhaps a developer's query or debugging information.
