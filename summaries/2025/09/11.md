# Activity Summary for 9/11/2025

## 12:43:07 PM
The log shows three consecutive modifications to the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/service_catalog/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/post_service_catalog_item_param_mapper.dart`.  All changes occur within a very short time frame (between 12:39:26 PM and 12:39:50 PM on September 11th, 2025).

The modifications center around the `toApiParam()` method within the `PostServiceCatalogItemParamMapper` extension.  Specifically, the changes affect the handling of the `ccEmails` parameter.

* **First version (12:39:26 PM):** Contains an incomplete `if` statement for checking `ccEmails`.

* **Second version (12:39:41 PM):** The incomplete `if` statement is modified, attempting to check `ccEmails` for a `isNot` condition (the exact meaning of this condition depends on the context of `isNot`).

* **Third version (12:39:50 PM):** The `if` statement is completely removed, suggesting the null check or conditional logic was deemed unnecessary or incorrect.

In essence, the changes reflect an iterative debugging or refinement process focused on correctly handling the `ccEmails` parameter within the `toApiParam()` method.  The final version removes the conditional logic for `ccEmails`.  The imports and the rest of the `toApiParam` function remained unchanged throughout.
