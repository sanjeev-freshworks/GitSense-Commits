# Activity Summary for 9/12/2025

## 1:15:07 PM
The log shows code changes related to the `journey_lib` module, focusing on the implementation of `Get Journey Task Detail` and `Get Journey Data` use cases and data layer components.  The initial changes (around 11:26 AM) involved refining prompts for code generation, specifically clarifying notes on `displayId` and its relationship to `taskId`.  These prompts repeatedly specify using  `.github/context/journey_task_details_usecase_diagram.md` as a tech design document.

Between 11:32 AM and 11:33 AM, the `get_journey_task_details_use_case.dart` file was updated multiple times, with no discernible changes in the code itself during these updates.  This suggests potential version control or save operations rather than functional changes.  A subsequent modification at 11:43 AM added input validation to this use case.  Further updates at 11:47 AM simplified the use case by removing unnecessary validation logic, only to revert and modify parameter naming conventions, changing `displayId` to `taskDisplayId` at 11:52 AM.

The `journey_lib_remote_data_source.dart` file underwent several revisions between 11:38 AM and 11:41 AM.  These revisions primarily focused on robust error handling, changing the return type of `getJourneyTaskDetail` to `Future<JourneyTaskDetail?>` and adding exception handling for null responses. This included changing the exception type from a generic `Exception` to `RequiredDataMissingInApiResponseException`.

At 11:49 AM and 11:50 AM, the  `get_journey_task_details_use_case_test.dart` file was modified to simplify assertions in the success test case.

The `journey.md` file was repeatedly updated between 11:54 AM and 12:17 PM, with no apparent changes to the API documentation.

Starting around 12:05 PM, the prompts for data layer code generation were extensively modified, primarily adjusting the specification of query parameters (`source`, `canonical name`, `approval_filter`, `type`) and the handling of nullable fields.  The initial prompt specified only path parameters, and then evolved to include various combinations of path and query parameters, ultimately settling on the  `Get Journey Data` API and defining parameters and nullable fields. This resulted in the creation of  `get_journey_data_query.dart` and `get_journey_data_query_mapper.dart` files (around 12:25 PM and 12:30 PM respectively) along with `journey_data_api_model.dart` (1:14 PM).

Between 12:36 PM and 12:45 PM, the use case generation prompts were altered to focus on implementing the `Get Journey Data` use case, with several iterations adjusting the notes and test input parameters. Finally, the `get_journey_data_use_case.dart` (12:48 PM) and  `get_journey_data_expected_io.dart` (12:48 PM) files were added, and `get_journey_data_use_case_test.dart` (12:49 PM) was created for testing, showing a pattern of use case implementation followed by unit tests. The `get_journey_data_query_mapper.dart` file was also modified to properly handle the conversion of integers to strings in query parameters (12:52 PM).

The final major change involved the creation and subsequent small modifications  of a diagram file `journey_tech_diagram.md` (12:42 PM and 12:43 PM) showcasing the use case and domain diagrams for both `Get Journey Task Details` and `Get Journey Data`.


## 2:14:59 PM
The log shows a series of code changes related to a Freshservice mobile application's journey management functionality.  The most significant changes occurred between 1:15 PM and 1:51 PM on September 12th, 2025.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/journey_task_detail_api_model.dart`: This file was updated at 1:15 PM.  The changes involved creating or modifying Dart classes (`JourneyTaskDetailApiModel`, `JourneyTaskApiModel`, `AgentApiModel`, `AdditionalDataApiModel`, `ServiceItemsApiModel`, `ServiceItemFieldsApiModel`) using the `json_annotation` package for JSON serialization/deserialization. These classes represent the data structures for journey task details, including task information, agent details, and additional data such as service items and custom fields.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/usecase/helper/get_journey_task_details_expected_io.dart`: Updated at 1:18 PM, this file contains a test helper class (`GetJourneyTaskDetailsExpectedIo`) defining expected input and output for a "Get Journey Task Details" use case. This suggests unit testing is in progress for the journey task retrieval functionality.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/support_portal/journey/update_journey_task/success.json`: This file was modified multiple times (1:27 PM, 1:32 PM) to provide mock JSON responses for successful journey task updates.  The later updates (1:32 PM) added significantly more detail to the response, including custom fields, planned start/end dates, and attachments, indicating a more comprehensive mock response is being developed to cover various scenarios.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/support_portal/journey/journey.md`: This Markdown file, documenting Journey APIs, underwent multiple revisions between 1:33 PM and 1:51 PM. These revisions focused primarily on refining the documentation for the "Update Journey Task" endpoint, adding details about the path parameters, request body, and clarifying the response.  The final revision at 1:51 PM also renamed the section from "Update Journey Task" to "Update Journey Task - Form", suggesting a specific form-related update functionality is being documented.

In summary, the code changes reflect development and testing of features related to retrieving and updating journey task details within the Freshservice mobile application.  The updates to the mock API responses and documentation indicate thorough testing and documentation efforts are underway.  A pattern of adding more comprehensive information and handling of various data types (especially custom fields) within the journey task models is evident.
