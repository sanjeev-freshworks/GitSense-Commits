# Activity Summary for 9/12/2025

## 1:15:07 PM
The log shows code changes related to the `journey_lib` module, focusing on the implementation of `Get Journey Task Detail` and `Get Journey Data` use cases and data layer components.  The initial changes (around 11:26 AM) involved refining prompts for code generation, specifically clarifying notes on `displayId` and its relationship to `taskId`.  These prompts repeatedly specify using  `.github/context/journey_task_details_usecase_diagram.md` as a tech design document.

Between 11:32 AM and 11:33 AM, the `get_journey_task_details_use_case.dart` file was updated multiple times, with no discernible changes in the code itself during these updates.  This suggests potential version control or save operations rather than functional changes.  A subsequent modification at 11:43 AM added input validation to this use case.  Further updates at 11:47 AM simplified the use case by removing unnecessary validation logic, only to revert and modify parameter naming conventions, changing `displayId` to `taskDisplayId` at 11:52 AM.

The `journey_lib_remote_data_source.dart` file underwent several revisions between 11:38 AM and 11:41 AM.  These revisions primarily focused on robust error handling, changing the return type of `getJourneyTaskDetail` to `Future<JourneyTaskDetail?>` and adding exception handling for null responses. This included changing the exception type from a generic `Exception` to `RequiredDataMissingInApiResponseException`.

At 11:49 AM and 11:50 AM, the  `get_journey_task_details_use_case_test.dart` file was modified to simplify assertions in the success test case.

The `journey.md` file was repeatedly updated between 11:54 AM and 12:17 PM, with no apparent changes to the API documentation.

Starting around 12:05 PM, the prompts for data layer code generation were extensively modified, primarily adjusting the specification of query parameters (`source`, `canonical name`, `approval_filter`, `type`) and the handling of nullable fields.  The initial prompt specified only path parameters, and then evolved to include various combinations of path and query parameters, ultimately settling on the  `Get Journey Data` API and defining parameters and nullable fields. This resulted in the creation of  `get_journey_data_query.dart` and `get_journey_data_query_mapper.dart` files (around 12:25 PM and 12:30 PM respectively) along with `journey_data_api_model.dart` (1:14 PM).

Between 12:36 PM and 12:45 PM, the use case generation prompts were altered to focus on implementing the `Get Journey Data` use case, with several iterations adjusting the notes and test input parameters. Finally, the `get_journey_data_use_case.dart` (12:48 PM) and  `get_journey_data_expected_io.dart` (12:48 PM) files were added, and `get_journey_data_use_case_test.dart` (12:49 PM) was created for testing, showing a pattern of use case implementation followed by unit tests. The `get_journey_data_query_mapper.dart` file was also modified to properly handle the conversion of integers to strings in query parameters (12:52 PM).

The final major change involved the creation and subsequent small modifications  of a diagram file `journey_tech_diagram.md` (12:42 PM and 12:43 PM) showcasing the use case and domain diagrams for both `Get Journey Task Details` and `Get Journey Data`.


## 2:14:59 PM
The log shows a series of code changes related to a Freshservice mobile application's journey management functionality.  The most significant changes occurred between 1:15 PM and 1:51 PM on September 12th, 2025.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/journey_task_detail_api_model.dart`: This file was updated at 1:15 PM.  The changes involved creating or modifying Dart classes (`JourneyTaskDetailApiModel`, `JourneyTaskApiModel`, `AgentApiModel`, `AdditionalDataApiModel`, `ServiceItemsApiModel`, `ServiceItemFieldsApiModel`) using the `json_annotation` package for JSON serialization/deserialization. These classes represent the data structures for journey task details, including task information, agent details, and additional data such as service items and custom fields.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/usecase/helper/get_journey_task_details_expected_io.dart`: Updated at 1:18 PM, this file contains a test helper class (`GetJourneyTaskDetailsExpectedIo`) defining expected input and output for a "Get Journey Task Details" use case. This suggests unit testing is in progress for the journey task retrieval functionality.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/support_portal/journey/update_journey_task/success.json`: This file was modified multiple times (1:27 PM, 1:32 PM) to provide mock JSON responses for successful journey task updates.  The later updates (1:32 PM) added significantly more detail to the response, including custom fields, planned start/end dates, and attachments, indicating a more comprehensive mock response is being developed to cover various scenarios.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/support_portal/journey/journey.md`: This Markdown file, documenting Journey APIs, underwent multiple revisions between 1:33 PM and 1:51 PM. These revisions focused primarily on refining the documentation for the "Update Journey Task" endpoint, adding details about the path parameters, request body, and clarifying the response.  The final revision at 1:51 PM also renamed the section from "Update Journey Task" to "Update Journey Task - Form", suggesting a specific form-related update functionality is being documented.

In summary, the code changes reflect development and testing of features related to retrieving and updating journey task details within the Freshservice mobile application.  The updates to the mock API responses and documentation indicate thorough testing and documentation efforts are underway.  A pattern of adding more comprehensive information and handling of various data types (especially custom fields) within the journey task models is evident.


## 3:15:03 PM
The log shows modifications to a single markdown file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/support_portal/journey/journey.md`.  This file documents Freshservice API endpoints related to "Journeys."

The most significant changes occur between  2:40 PM and 2:43 PM on September 12th, 2025.  These changes primarily involve the  `Update Journey Task - Form` section. Initially, the request body for this section is incomplete or absent (`Body -`).  Over several edits, the request body is progressively refined, ultimately becoming a well-formed JSON object with nested structures detailing `it_task`, `additional_data`, `service_items`, and numerous custom fields (`cf_...`).  The final version includes a complete response section with a link to a success JSON file (`[Body](../../../../response/support_portal/journey/update_journey_task/success.json)`).


Around 2:42 PM, a new section, `Update Journey Task - Simple Task`, is added, indicating the documentation now covers two distinct update methods.  The structure and style of the documentation remain consistent throughout the log, with each API endpoint described using a similar table format outlining the method, path, request, response, and notes.


## 4:15:05 PM
The log shows a series of changes related to the Freshservice mobile API mock, focusing on Journey APIs.  Initially, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/support_portal/journey/journey.md`  was updated multiple times between 3:31 PM and 3:36 PM on September 12th, 2025. These updates primarily involved refining the documentation for various Journey API endpoints: `Get Journey Activity List`, `Get Journey Task Detail`, `Get Journey Data`, and `Update Journey Task` (both simple task and form variations).  The changes primarily involved the request body examples for `Update Journey Task` calls. A new response file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/support_portal/journey/update_journey_task/simple_task_success.json`, was added at 3:32 PM containing a sample successful response for a simple task update.

Subsequently, between 3:45 PM and 3:57 PM, the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md` underwent numerous revisions. These revisions represent iterative refinements of a prompt for code generation, specifically for data layer code. The prompt's evolution centers around specifying API details for the `Update Journey Task` endpoint, including path, body parameters (particularly clarifying the `custom_fields` parameter's optional nature and default value), and the handling of response bodies (eventually deciding to ignore the response body and focus solely on the status code). The final revision at 3:57 PM focuses on generating code for the `Update Journey Task - Simple Task` endpoint.

Finally, several Dart files within the `journey_lib` module were created and updated between 3:58 PM and 4:11 PM.  `journey_lib_remote_constants.dart` defines constants for API paths and parameters.  `update_journey_task_request.dart` defines a request model for updating journey tasks.  `journey_lib_remote_data_source.dart` implements the remote data source, handling API calls for retrieving journey task details, journey data, and updating journey tasks.  The `putUpdateJourneyTask` function initially returned a response object, but later changed to only return `void`. The `journey_lib_repository.dart` and `journey_lib_repository_impl.dart` files define and implement the repository interface, respectively. The repository interface changed from returning `UpdateJourneyTaskResponse` to `void` for the `updateJourneyTask` function, reflecting the change in the remote data source. The `HttpHeaders.contentTypeHeader` was corrected in the `journey_lib_remote_data_source.dart` to use the correct mime type.  These files exhibit a consistent pattern of using a data model/api model mapping strategy.


## 5:15:08 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/domain/usecase/update_journey_task_use_case.dart` file between 4:27 PM and 4:44 PM on September 12th, 2025.  These changes involved the implementation of an `UpdateJourneyTaskUseCase` which interacts with a `JourneyLibRepository` to update journey tasks.  The initial versions were incomplete, indicated by `{}` or `throw UnimplementedError()`. The use case was progressively refined, adding parameters like `taskId`, `displayId`, and `status` (of type `JourneyActivityTaskStatus`).  The `UpdateJourneyTaskRequest` class was also created and updated to include necessary parameters for the API call, including a `customFields` map.

A new file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/request/update_journey_task_request_mapper.dart`,  was introduced (around 4:36 PM) to handle the mapping of the `UpdateJourneyTaskRequest` object to an API-compatible JSON format.  The `toJson` method was later renamed to `toApiParam`.

Simultaneously, between 4:41 PM and 4:48 PM, unit tests for `UpdateJourneyTaskUseCase` were added in  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/usecase/update_journey_task_use_case_test.dart`, and the helper file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/usecase/helper/update_journey_task_expected_io.dart` was created and populated to support these tests.  These tests seem to focus on verifying the successful execution of the use case.

Finally, dependency injection related changes occurred in the `journey_lib_domain_module.dart` (around 4:47PM) and test files, ensuring the proper registration of the use case within the dependency injection framework.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/journey_lib_remote_constants.dart` file defines API paths and parameters used in the application.


Changes to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/freshservice_data.json` show modifications to a JSON data structure seemingly used for mocking Freshservice API responses during testing. This file was modified several times between 4:57 PM and 5:11 PM, likely reflecting updates to the mock data required for comprehensive test coverage.  The specific changes to this file are not detailed enough for further summarization.
