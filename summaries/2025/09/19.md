# Activity Summary for 9/19/2025

## 2:35:14 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail/view/content/component/journey_data_widget.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail/view/content/journey_simple_task_detail_content.dart` between 4:15 PM and 10:46 PM on September 18, 2025.

The `journey_data_widget.dart` file underwent extensive changes focusing primarily on the layout and presentation of data within a card.  Initial versions showed attempts at arranging data horizontally or vertically based on the type and number of data items (`JourneyDataUIModel`).  Later edits refined this, consistently using a `Column` for the main layout and conditionally rendering a `Row` for horizontal arrangement of up to two data items, with spacing adjustments using `MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround` or `MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly` for better visual distribution. The `crossAxisAlignment` property of both the `Column` and the `Row` was also adjusted multiple times, eventually settling on `CrossAxisAlignment.start` and `CrossAxisAlignment.baseline` respectively in different versions to improve vertical alignment of the items.  The text styling within `_buildJourneyDataItem` was also modified, changing the color and potentially the size of the field labels (`fieldLabel`).  A padding was added within the card in the final versions using `Padding(padding: const EdgeInsets.all(space16))`.  The most significant changes occurred between 4:24 PM and 4:34 PM.


The `journey_simple_task_detail_content.dart` file's changes were more concise.  The main modification involved integrating the `JourneyDataWidget` into the layout at around 4:18 PM, adding it to display journey data above the `CustomWebViewWidget`.  A final layout change at 4:22 PM moved the `SingleChildScrollView` from encompassing the entire content to only the `Expanded` section containing the `JourneyDataWidget` and `CustomWebViewWidget`. This improves scrolling behavior.
