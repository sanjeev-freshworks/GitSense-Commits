# Activity Summary for 9/15/2025

## 4:53:42 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/journey_tech_diagram.md` between 3:53 PM and 4:46 PM on September 15, 2025.  The file contains Mermaid class diagrams detailing the design of a "Journey" feature.

The edits primarily focus on refining the `Journey Task Details Presentation Diagram`.  Initially, this diagram showed only the `JourneySimpleTaskState` class.  Subsequent edits added classes representing different states of the UI (`JourneySimpleTaskUIState`, which is further broken down into `Error`, `Loading`, and `Content`), navigation states (`JourneySimpleTaskNavigationState`), and user actions (`OpenJourneyDataBottomSheet`, `JourneyDataViewMoreClicked`, `MarkAsDoneClicked`, `NavigationAndUserMessageHandled`).  The `Content` state was progressively expanded to include more detailed UI model properties and relationships between classes are defined using `*--` (composition) and `<|--` (inheritance). The `TaskStateUIState` is further broken down into `Pending` and `Past` states.  These changes suggest an iterative design process, progressively fleshing out the UI state management for a more robust and feature-rich presentation layer.

The `Journey Task Details Use Case Diagram` and `Journey Data Domain Diagram` remained largely unchanged throughout the edits, indicating that the core use case and data models were relatively stable during this period.  The consistent use of Mermaid syntax for the diagrams throughout the log is also noteworthy.
