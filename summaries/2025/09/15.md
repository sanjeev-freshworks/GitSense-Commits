# Activity Summary for 9/15/2025

## 4:53:42 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/journey_tech_diagram.md` between 3:53 PM and 4:46 PM on September 15, 2025.  The file contains Mermaid class diagrams detailing the design of a "Journey" feature.

The edits primarily focus on refining the `Journey Task Details Presentation Diagram`.  Initially, this diagram showed only the `JourneySimpleTaskState` class.  Subsequent edits added classes representing different states of the UI (`JourneySimpleTaskUIState`, which is further broken down into `Error`, `Loading`, and `Content`), navigation states (`JourneySimpleTaskNavigationState`), and user actions (`OpenJourneyDataBottomSheet`, `JourneyDataViewMoreClicked`, `MarkAsDoneClicked`, `NavigationAndUserMessageHandled`).  The `Content` state was progressively expanded to include more detailed UI model properties and relationships between classes are defined using `*--` (composition) and `<|--` (inheritance). The `TaskStateUIState` is further broken down into `Pending` and `Past` states.  These changes suggest an iterative design process, progressively fleshing out the UI state management for a more robust and feature-rich presentation layer.

The `Journey Task Details Use Case Diagram` and `Journey Data Domain Diagram` remained largely unchanged throughout the edits, indicating that the core use case and data models were relatively stable during this period.  The consistent use of Mermaid syntax for the diagrams throughout the log is also noteworthy.


## 5:53:46 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/presentation/model/journey_task_detail.prompt.md` between 4:54 PM and 5:05 PM on September 15, 2025.  These edits primarily involve refining the input parameters for a `presentation_layer_models_codegen` prompt.  The changes iterate on the `Feature Name` (remaining consistently as `Journey Task Detail`),  `Feature Path`, and `Product Requirements Document (PRD)` and `Technical Design` file paths.  Initially, the `Feature Path` is incorrectly specified, later corrected to `libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail`. The PRD and Technical Design file paths are also refined from placeholder names (`Approval Delegate PRD.md`, `Approval Delegate TD.md`)  to  `journey_prd.md` and `journey_tech_diagram.md` respectively.  The "Any task-specific notes" section is also refined to specify only the relevant user story from the PRD and section from the tech design.

Following this, several Dart files under `libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail/presentation/model` are modified between 5:05 PM and 5:23 PM on September 15, 2025.  These changes introduce and refine models using the `freezed` package for `JourneyTaskDetailNavigationState`, `JourneyDataUIModel`, `JourneySimpleTaskUIModel`, and `JourneyTaskDetailUIState`.  The `JourneyTaskDetailUIState` model undergoes several revisions to correctly type its fields using the newly defined models, changing `dynamic` to specific model types. The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail/presentation/model/state/journey_task_detail_ui_state.dart` shows the most revisions.  `journey_task_simple_ui_model.dart` is renamed to `journey_simple_task_ui_model.dart` and its content is updated accordingly.  Also, there are two almost identical edits to `libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/journey_lib.dart`, seemingly unnecessary.

Finally, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/presentation/uimapper/journey_task_detail.prompt.md` is updated at 5:25 PM and 5:26 PM on September 15, 2025, to prepare input for  `presentation_layer_ui_mapper_codegen` similarly to the model codegen prompt.   The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/journey_tech_diagram.md` file contains extensive mermaid diagrams detailing use cases and models for the Journey Task Detail feature.  The file is updated twice, at 5:26 PM and 5:27 PM, but the content appears identical. A `journey_task_detail_ui_mapper.dart` file is created and updated multiple times between 5:38 PM and 5:39 PM;  this is a UI mapper class responsible for converting domain models to UI models.  Finally, test files (`journey_task_detail_fixture.dart`, `journey_data_fixture.dart`, and `journey_task_detail_ui_mapper_test.dart`) are created and updated, likely to test the newly created models and mappers. The localization file (`intl_en.arb`) undergoes several minor revisions, removing the `viewMore` key.
