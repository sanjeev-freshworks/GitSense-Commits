# Activity Summary for 9/15/2025

## 4:53:42 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/journey_tech_diagram.md` between 3:53 PM and 4:46 PM on September 15, 2025.  The file contains Mermaid class diagrams detailing the design of a "Journey" feature.

The edits primarily focus on refining the `Journey Task Details Presentation Diagram`.  Initially, this diagram showed only the `JourneySimpleTaskState` class.  Subsequent edits added classes representing different states of the UI (`JourneySimpleTaskUIState`, which is further broken down into `Error`, `Loading`, and `Content`), navigation states (`JourneySimpleTaskNavigationState`), and user actions (`OpenJourneyDataBottomSheet`, `JourneyDataViewMoreClicked`, `MarkAsDoneClicked`, `NavigationAndUserMessageHandled`).  The `Content` state was progressively expanded to include more detailed UI model properties and relationships between classes are defined using `*--` (composition) and `<|--` (inheritance). The `TaskStateUIState` is further broken down into `Pending` and `Past` states.  These changes suggest an iterative design process, progressively fleshing out the UI state management for a more robust and feature-rich presentation layer.

The `Journey Task Details Use Case Diagram` and `Journey Data Domain Diagram` remained largely unchanged throughout the edits, indicating that the core use case and data models were relatively stable during this period.  The consistent use of Mermaid syntax for the diagrams throughout the log is also noteworthy.


## 5:53:46 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/presentation/model/journey_task_detail.prompt.md` between 4:54 PM and 5:05 PM on September 15, 2025.  These edits primarily involve refining the input parameters for a `presentation_layer_models_codegen` prompt.  The changes iterate on the `Feature Name` (remaining consistently as `Journey Task Detail`),  `Feature Path`, and `Product Requirements Document (PRD)` and `Technical Design` file paths.  Initially, the `Feature Path` is incorrectly specified, later corrected to `libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail`. The PRD and Technical Design file paths are also refined from placeholder names (`Approval Delegate PRD.md`, `Approval Delegate TD.md`)  to  `journey_prd.md` and `journey_tech_diagram.md` respectively.  The "Any task-specific notes" section is also refined to specify only the relevant user story from the PRD and section from the tech design.

Following this, several Dart files under `libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail/presentation/model` are modified between 5:05 PM and 5:23 PM on September 15, 2025.  These changes introduce and refine models using the `freezed` package for `JourneyTaskDetailNavigationState`, `JourneyDataUIModel`, `JourneySimpleTaskUIModel`, and `JourneyTaskDetailUIState`.  The `JourneyTaskDetailUIState` model undergoes several revisions to correctly type its fields using the newly defined models, changing `dynamic` to specific model types. The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail/presentation/model/state/journey_task_detail_ui_state.dart` shows the most revisions.  `journey_task_simple_ui_model.dart` is renamed to `journey_simple_task_ui_model.dart` and its content is updated accordingly.  Also, there are two almost identical edits to `libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/journey_lib.dart`, seemingly unnecessary.

Finally, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/presentation/uimapper/journey_task_detail.prompt.md` is updated at 5:25 PM and 5:26 PM on September 15, 2025, to prepare input for  `presentation_layer_ui_mapper_codegen` similarly to the model codegen prompt.   The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/journey_tech_diagram.md` file contains extensive mermaid diagrams detailing use cases and models for the Journey Task Detail feature.  The file is updated twice, at 5:26 PM and 5:27 PM, but the content appears identical. A `journey_task_detail_ui_mapper.dart` file is created and updated multiple times between 5:38 PM and 5:39 PM;  this is a UI mapper class responsible for converting domain models to UI models.  Finally, test files (`journey_task_detail_fixture.dart`, `journey_data_fixture.dart`, and `journey_task_detail_ui_mapper_test.dart`) are created and updated, likely to test the newly created models and mappers. The localization file (`intl_en.arb`) undergoes several minor revisions, removing the `viewMore` key.


## 6:53:53 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/freshservice_data.json` between 5:56 PM and 6:34 PM on September 15, 2025.  These updates appear to involve minor adjustments to the JSON data structure, with no discernible pattern in the changes beyond the repeated nature of the updates themselves. The JSON data represents a hierarchical structure of folders and routes, likely for a Freshservice API mock.  There are no significant content changes across these updates; the structure and most of the UUIDs and data remain consistent.


A Dart file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail/presentation/helper/mapper/journey_task_detail_ui_mapper.dart`, was modified twice, at 6:47 PM and 6:52 PM on September 15, 2025.  The changes involved adding and refactoring the `JourneyTaskDetailUIMapper` class.  The key change between the two commits is the refactoring of the `formatDateUseCase` dependency injection. Initially, `formatDateUseCase` was passed as an argument to the `protectedMap` method, but later it was refactored to be injected directly in the class constructor and stored as a private field. This improved dependency management within the mapper class.  The mapper is designed to convert domain models (`JourneyTaskDetail`, `JourneyData`) into UI models (`JourneySimpleTaskUIModel`, `JourneyDataUIModel`).  The mapper handles different task states (completed, open, in-progress), formatting dates accordingly using the injected `formatDateUseCase`.  There is a TODO comment indicating future work to handle attachment field types.


## 7:53:51 PM
The log shows a series of commits related to the "Journey Task Detail" feature in a Flutter mobile application.  The changes primarily focus on the presentation layer (Bloc and UI).

On **September 15, 2025**, several modifications were made to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/journey_tech_diagram.md` file between 6:59 PM and 7:01 PM. These changes involved adding and refining  `mermaid` diagrams illustrating the Use Case, Domain, and Presentation layer architecture for the Journey Task Detail feature. Specifically, the Bloc diagram was progressively elaborated to include dependencies on `GetJourneyDataUseCase`, `UpdateJourneyTaskUseCase`, and `GetJourneyTaskDetailsUseCase`.

Simultaneously,  the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/presentation/bloc/journey_task_detail_bloc.prompt.md` file underwent multiple revisions between 7:02 PM and 7:06 PM.  These revisions adjusted the input parameters for a code generation prompt, consistently focusing on the `Journey Task Detail` feature and specifying  the relevant sections of the technical design document (`journey_tech_diagram.md`) as input for code generation.

The core functionality of the `JourneyTaskDetailBloc` was implemented in the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail/presentation/bloc/journey_task_detail_bloc.dart` file.  This file saw multiple updates between 7:06 PM and 7:52 PM.  These modifications focused on refining the Bloc's logic and structure, handling loading and error states, updating the task status, and managing navigation states and user messages.  Importantly, the code was adapted to use `UserMessage` for displaying feedback to the user.

Finally, extensive unit testing was performed and refined in the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/ui/task_detail/presentation/bloc/journey_task_detail_bloc_test.dart` file from 7:15 PM to 7:26 PM.  The test suite comprehensively covers various scenarios including successful and failed use cases, focusing on verifying the Bloc's state transitions and interactions with dependent use cases and analytics tracking.  The tests were improved by using `UCResult.error` instead of `UCResult.failure` and more precisely defining the `JourneyTaskDetailUIMapper` input and outputs. The final versions of the tests also utilized  `JourneyLibLocalizationsEn()` and `CommonUILocalizationsEn()` for localization.


## 8:53:57 PM
The codebase comprises several Dart files related to a Flutter application's "Journey Task Detail" feature.  Significant changes occurred between 7:55 PM and 8:15 PM on September 15, 2025.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail/presentation/bloc/journey_task_detail_bloc.dart`  This file, a BLoC (Business Logic Component), manages the UI state and events for the task detail screen.  It handles events like `JourneyTaskDetailUIEventViewCreated`, `JourneyDataViewMoreClicked`, `MarkAsDoneClicked`, and `NavigationAndUserMessageHandled`.  The bloc fetches task details and associated journey data using use cases (`GetJourneyTaskDetailsUseCase`, `GetJourneyDataUseCase`), updates task status using `UpdateJourneyTaskUseCase`, maps data to UI models via `JourneyTaskDetailUIMapper`, and tracks analytics with `FSAnalytics`.  Multiple updates to this file reflect iterative development and error handling improvements.  The final version includes more robust error handling and uses a more descriptive error message ("Sorry, an error occurred. Please try again later").

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail/presentation/model/state/journey_simple_task_state.dart` This file defines the `JourneySimpleTaskState` class, which holds the UI state (`JourneyTaskDetailUIState`) and navigation state (`JourneyTaskDetailNavigationState?`) for the task detail screen.  The initial version lacked imports; these were added in subsequent commits.  A final update uses the `freezed` package for immutable state management.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/task_detail/presentation/model/state/journey_task_detail_ui_state.dart` This file defines the `JourneyTaskDetailUIState` using the `freezed` annotation package, creating a sealed class with states for loading, content, and error. The content state includes UI models, a progress indicator flag, and a user message.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/ui/task_detail/presentation/bloc/journey_task_detail_bloc_test.dart` This file contains unit tests for the `JourneyTaskDetailBloc`. The tests cover various scenarios for each event handler, including success and failure cases.  Multiple updates refined the tests, particularly around error handling and the use of `anyNamed` for mocking analytics tracking.  The final version uses more precise assertions and better simulates the flow of events including the initial `ViewCreated` event before other events are triggered, thus improving test coverage and clarity.  The tests extensively utilize mock objects for use cases and the UI mapper.  The tests also include a time delay to allow for asynchronous actions to complete before assertions are made.


A recurring theme across the changes is the progressive enhancement of error handling and the consistent use of  `freezed` for immutable state management, improving the overall code quality and testability.  The tests consistently cover success and failure paths for each event, reflecting a focus on robust error handling.
