# Activity Summary for 9/8/2025

## 12:19:24 PM
The log shows multiple modifications to JSON files used for mocking Freshservice API responses and a Dart file for test data.  The most significant changes occur between 11:32 AM and 11:48 AM on September 8th, 2025, involving `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/common/user/bootstrap_account/success.json`. This file is repeatedly updated, with the primary change being the replacement of `"mkp_api_key": "test_mapi_key"` with `"mkp_api_key": "test_mkp_api_key"` and finally updating the  `"auth_token"` from a long string to `"test_auth_token"`.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/freshservice_data.json` is updated at 11:36:40 AM on September 8th, 2025. This file appears to define the structure of mocked Freshservice data, including UUIDs, folder names ("Ticket," "Scenario Automation," "Common," etc.), and nested folder structures.  The large number of UUIDs and folder names suggests a complex data model.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/change/test/domain/helper/create_change_expected_io.dart` shows a code change at 11:37:42 AM on September 8th, 2025.  This Dart file defines expected input/output for creating a change request, including detailed sample data for various fields like subject, description, status, assets, custom fields, and planning fields. Notably, the description fields contain HTML formatting and embedded images.


Between 11:40 AM and 11:47 AM on September 8th, 2025, there are multiple updates to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/functional/requester/tickets/details/service_request.json`. This file likely provides mock data for a service request ticket detail, containing information about notes, status, subject, custom fields, and attachments. The repeated modifications suggest iterative adjustments to the mock data.

Finally, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/support_portal/user/get_user/success.json` is updated at 11:58:54 AM on September 8th, 2025. This file contains a mock response for retrieving user information from the support portal.


A recurring pattern is the use of placeholders like "test_mkp_api_key" and "test_auth_token," and the consistent use of timestamps in ISO 8601 format within the JSON files.  The prevalence of numerous custom fields (indicated by IDs like `597524`) across multiple JSON files points to extensive customization within the Freshservice instance being mocked.  Many files contain embedded HTML and images, suggesting a rich text-based interface.


## 3:29:52 PM
The log shows two updates to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/change/test/domain/helper/create_change_expected_io.dart`, a Dart file seemingly related to creating change requests within a Freshservice application.  The changes occurred within a minute of each other: 2:47:46 PM and 2:48:11 PM on September 8th, 2025.

Both versions define a `CreateChangeExpectedIo` class with a `success` method returning a tuple of `CreateChangeSubmissionParam` and `UCSuccessResult<void>`.  The core difference lies within the `description` field of the `PlanningFieldParam` nested within `planningFields` of `CreateChangeSubmissionParam`.

Specifically, the second version modifies the image source within the `change_impact`  `PlanningFieldParam`'s `description`.  The initial log entry contained a long, seemingly encoded URL;  this was replaced with `"test_token"` in the second entry, suggesting a change to how image attachments are handled or represented in testing.  No other significant changes are observed in the code.  The rest of the `CreateChangeSubmissionParam` object, including  `subject`, other fields in `planningFields`, `assets`, `customFields`, and `attachments` remain largely unchanged between the two commits.


## 6:29:55 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/components/image/fs_network_image.dart` between 6:03:19 PM and 6:05:39 PM on September 8, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is enhancing the `FsNetworkImage` widget's error handling and retry mechanism for network image loading.

Initially, the code lacked any retry logic.  Subsequent commits introduced:

1. **Using `widget` properties:** The code was refactored to consistently use `widget` properties (e.g., `widget.url`, `widget.placeholder`, `widget.size`, `widget.headers`) instead of directly accessing properties from the `_FsNetworkImageState` class. This occurred between the first and second timestamps.


2. **Retry mechanism:**  A retry mechanism was added to the `errorBuilder` function. The `_shouldRetry` function was introduced to determine if an error warrants a retry, initially focusing on Flutter image decoding errors.  This happened around 6:03:46 PM.


3. **Retry delay:** The retry mechanism initially used `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback` to trigger a rebuild. This was later changed at 6:04:12 PM to `Future.delayed` with a delay increasing with each retry attempt (100 milliseconds * retry count), aiming to alleviate memory pressure.


4. **HTTP error handling:** At 6:04:24 PM, the `_shouldRetry` function was updated to explicitly exclude HTTP errors (4xx and 5xx status codes) from retry attempts. This is a significant improvement, preventing unnecessary retries for issues like 404 (Not Found) errors.

5. **Expanded error conditions:** The `_shouldRetry` function was further extended at 6:04:24 PM to include more comprehensive error strings for more robust error handling related to image decoding.  There were no further code changes after 6:05:16 PM.

In summary, the evolution of `fs_network_image.dart` demonstrates a progressive improvement in the robustness of image loading, handling various error conditions with a well-defined retry strategy that avoids unnecessary retries and considers memory management.  The consistent use of logging (`FSLogger`) throughout the code aids in debugging and monitoring image loading issues.
