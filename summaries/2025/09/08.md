# Activity Summary for 9/8/2025

## 12:19:24 PM
The log shows multiple modifications to JSON files used for mocking Freshservice API responses and a Dart file for test data.  The most significant changes occur between 11:32 AM and 11:48 AM on September 8th, 2025, involving `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/common/user/bootstrap_account/success.json`. This file is repeatedly updated, with the primary change being the replacement of `"mkp_api_key": "test_mapi_key"` with `"mkp_api_key": "test_mkp_api_key"` and finally updating the  `"auth_token"` from a long string to `"test_auth_token"`.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/freshservice_data.json` is updated at 11:36:40 AM on September 8th, 2025. This file appears to define the structure of mocked Freshservice data, including UUIDs, folder names ("Ticket," "Scenario Automation," "Common," etc.), and nested folder structures.  The large number of UUIDs and folder names suggests a complex data model.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/change/test/domain/helper/create_change_expected_io.dart` shows a code change at 11:37:42 AM on September 8th, 2025.  This Dart file defines expected input/output for creating a change request, including detailed sample data for various fields like subject, description, status, assets, custom fields, and planning fields. Notably, the description fields contain HTML formatting and embedded images.


Between 11:40 AM and 11:47 AM on September 8th, 2025, there are multiple updates to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/functional/requester/tickets/details/service_request.json`. This file likely provides mock data for a service request ticket detail, containing information about notes, status, subject, custom fields, and attachments. The repeated modifications suggest iterative adjustments to the mock data.

Finally, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/support_portal/user/get_user/success.json` is updated at 11:58:54 AM on September 8th, 2025. This file contains a mock response for retrieving user information from the support portal.


A recurring pattern is the use of placeholders like "test_mkp_api_key" and "test_auth_token," and the consistent use of timestamps in ISO 8601 format within the JSON files.  The prevalence of numerous custom fields (indicated by IDs like `597524`) across multiple JSON files points to extensive customization within the Freshservice instance being mocked.  Many files contain embedded HTML and images, suggesting a rich text-based interface.
