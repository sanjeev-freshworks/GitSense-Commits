# Activity Summary for 9/3/2025

## 11:59:36 AM
The provided log shows two significant code updates to the Freshservice mobile application's documentation.

The first update, at 11:34:48 AM on September 3rd, 2025, involved `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/solution_prd.md`.  This file appears to be a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a "Solutions" feature.  A second update to the same file followed at 11:36:35 AM on the same day, adding substantial detail to the PRD. This detailed update describes the Solutions feature, outlining requirements for navigating to the Solutions page, searching for articles, viewing category/folder/solution details, and viewing solution article details.  Each section specifies positive, negative, error, and edge case scenarios,  including non-functional requirements related to Heap events and UX considerations. The detail is quite thorough, covering various user roles (agents and requesters) and functionalities.

The second update, at 11:43:32 AM on September 3rd, 2025, involved `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/article_detail_tech_design.md`. This file contains the technical design for the "Article Detail" feature.  The update includes a domain diagram, a bloc diagram, and a navigation flow diagram, using Mermaid markdown to illustrate the relationships between different components (e.g., `GetArticleDetailUseCase`, `ArticleDetailRepository`, `ArticleDetailBloc`).  The diagrams show the data model, the flow of events within the application's architecture, and the navigation between screens.  The level of detail suggests this is a well-defined technical design intended to guide the development process.

In summary, the log illustrates a development process involving significant updates to both the product requirements and technical design specifications for features related to solution articles within the Freshservice mobile application. The changes were made within a short timeframe on the same day.  There's a clear progression from high-level requirements to a detailed technical design.


## 2:14:30 PM
The log shows two code change entries.  The first, at 1:12:23 PM on September 3rd, 2025, modifies `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/article_detail_tech_design.md`. This file contains a technical design document for an article detail feature, described using Mermaid diagrams.  The diagrams illustrate the domain model (classes: `GetArticleDetailUseCase`, `ArticleDetailModel`, `AttachmentModel`, `ArticleModel`, `ArticleDetailRepository`), the Bloc diagram showing the state transitions (states: `Initial`, `Loading`, `Content`, `Error`, `VotingInProgress`, `VotingError`), and the navigation flow.

The second entry, at 1:13:27 PM on the same day, details changes to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/test/ui/mapper/folder_detail_ui_mapper_test.dart`. This file contains a series of unit tests for `FolderDetailUIMapper`. These tests cover various scenarios, including mapping mixed folder items (folders, articles, external articles), handling empty lists, handling different article statuses (like draft articles), and dealing with null or missing data (e.g., `modifiedAt`, `authorName`, article and folder counts). The tests extensively use mock objects and fixtures for input data, ensuring thorough coverage of the mapper's functionality.  A notable pattern is the consistent testing of edge cases and null values within the input data, which is good testing practice to ensure robustness.  The `mockFormatDateUseCase` is used to simulate date formatting within the tests.


## 3:11:37 PM
The code changes primarily focus on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/form/businessrule/condition/validator/user/br_current_user_condition_validator.dart` file and  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/user_support_portal_remote_data_source.dart` file.

The `br_current_user_condition_validator.dart` file underwent several revisions between 2:51 PM and 3:09 PM on September 3, 2025.  The core change involved refining the `BRCurrentUserConditionValidatorInput` class. Initially, it lacked a field for custom fields; subsequent commits added a `customFields` field (first as `customFields`, then renamed to `customFieldsNames`, and finally settled on `customFields` as a `Map<String, String?>`). This suggests an iterative process of designing the input structure for handling custom user fields in validation.  The code itself remains largely consistent, focusing on validating user details against business rules.


The `user_support_portal_remote_data_source.dart` file saw modifications at 2:58 PM and 3:08 PM on September 3, 2025.  The significant change in the `getBootstrapMeForRequester` function involved logging the `user.customFields` data using `FSLogger`. A later commit removed a `return user;` line that seems to have been redundant or a leftover from debugging.  This file handles fetching user data, and the logging addition shows a focus on monitoring the custom fields retrieved.
