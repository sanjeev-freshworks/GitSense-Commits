# Activity Summary for 6/24/2025

## 2:14:26 PM
The log shows iterative development of a Dart file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/test/testfixture/ui/delegate_approvals/create_edit_delegate_approval_ui_model_fixture.dart`,  and its use in unit tests within `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/test/ui/delegate_approval/mapper/create_edit_delegate_approval_ui_mapper_test.dart`.

The `/create_edit_delegate_approval_ui_model_fixture.dart` file underwent significant changes between 11:51 AM and 12:00 PM on June 24, 2025. Initially, it was a simple class declaration.  Subsequent edits added imports from various packages (`approval_lib`, `form_lib`, `user_lib`),  a `generate` method to create `CreateEditDelegateApprovalUiModel` objects, and finally, separate `generateCreateMode` and `generateEditMode` methods to handle different scenarios for creating and editing delegate approvals.  These methods populate the UI model with various form fields (delegate to, from date, until date, notes) and localization strings.

The unit test file, `/create_edit_delegate_approval_ui_mapper_test.dart`, also evolved during this period.  Changes primarily involved updating the expected values in the tests to match the changes in the fixture file.  Initially, tests lacked a clear separation of create and edit modes. Later commits introduced more robust testing of the mapper for both create and edit modes, handling edge cases like missing or null values for delegate information.  A notable change around 12:12 PM and further refinements until 12:18 PM involved adding fixed `DateTime` values to the tests for creating deterministic test results and fixing the `expect` calls to account for these changes.  Finally, a helper function `expectModelsEqualIgnoringConstraints` was added at 12:16 PM to improve the comparison logic in tests by ignoring `DateTimeConstraint` differences.  A final cleanup at 12:33 PM simplified some code within the `expectModelsEqualIgnoringConstraints` function.  The use of `DateTime` constants defined in  `/test_constants.dart` (added at 12:15 PM), further enhanced test determinism.

In summary, the changes reflect a focused effort to improve the quality and reliability of the unit tests for the `CreateDelegateApprovalUiMapper` by creating more comprehensive test fixtures and a custom comparison logic to handle the non-deterministic nature of `DateTime.now()`. The evolution reflects a systematic approach to testing, improving code clarity, and ensuring test robustness.


## 6:51:38 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Dart test file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/test/ui/delegate_approval/mapper/create_edit_delegate_approval_ui_mapper_test.dart`,  between 6:22:07 PM and 6:26:49 PM on June 24, 2025.  The core functionality being tested involves a `CreateDelegateApprovalUiMapper` which maps input to a UI model for both create and edit modes of delegate approvals.

The initial revisions (6:22:07 PM, 6:22:51 PM) focused on comprehensive testing of the mapper's output, using `expect` statements to verify that the mapped UI model matched expected fixtures.  These tests included scenarios with and without edit arguments and handled cases with missing or empty delegatee fields.  A significant change occurred around 6:23:06 PM, with the addition of the import `'package:form_lib/form_lib.dart'`, suggesting an integration with a form library.

Subsequent revisions (6:23:06 PM, 6:23:25 PM, 6:23:39 PM, 6:24:37 PM) refined the tests by verifying specific fields within the generated UI model (`delegateToField`, `fromField`, `untilField`, `notesField`), focusing on their IDs, required status, editability, and values.  The `expect` statements moved from comparing entire objects to checking individual field properties for create and edit modes.

The most substantial update happened between 6:24:37 PM and 6:25:16 PM. This revision changed the assertions in the edit mode tests to reflect updates to the UI model.  Specifically, the test assertions now check for  `localizations.editDelegation` as the title, `commonUILocalizations.commonUpdate` as the button text, and `isButtonEnabled` set to `false`.  It also explicitly checks the editability and values of the  `fromField`, `untilField`, and `notesField`, demonstrating the functionality changed to reflect editing behavior. A minor change between 6:25:16 PM and 6:25:39 PM removed `core_ui` dependency and a final change between 6:25:39 PM and 6:26:49 PM changed the type of `notesField` to `FormParagraphFieldUIModel` and updated assertions accordingly.  Throughout the revisions, the structure of the test cases remained consistent, indicating a focus on enhancing the verification and handling of edge cases in the mapping process.
