# Activity Summary for 6/26/2025

## 3:45:41 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/components/datepicker/fs_date_picker.dart` file on June 26th, 2025, all between 3:09 PM and 3:10 PM.  The changes primarily focus on the `showFSDatePicker` function within this Dart file.

The initial versions (3:09:29 PM and 3:09:37 PM) had a minor typographical error corrected: a parameter `locatio` was changed to `location`.

A more significant change occurred between 3:09:37 PM and 3:09:55 PM.  The `initialDate` default value within the `showDatePicker` function was altered. It was initially set to `DateTime.now()` and changed to `TZDateTime.now(location:)`, integrating timezone functionality using the `timezone` package.

A final minor change at 3:10:05 PM involved a slight correction in the `TZDateTime.now(location:)` call, removing a stray colon, thereby finalizing the timezone integration.

Throughout the revisions, the file consistently used the `core_ui`, `flutter/material`, and `timezone` packages,  and the styling of the date picker remained consistent, applying a custom `DatePickerTheme` for color consistency.


## 4:45:59 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/ui/delegate_approval/presentation/helper/mapper/create_edit_delegate_approval_ui_mapper.dart` between 3:46 PM and 4:04 PM on June 26, 2025.  These changes primarily focus on the `_buildFromToDateTimeField` and `_buildUntilToTextField` functions within the `CreateDelegateApprovalUiMapper` class.  The modifications center around handling `DateTime` objects and converting them to `TZDateTime` using a `toTZDateTime` extension method added to the `DateTime` class in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/helper/extensions/date_time_extension.dart` between 3:51 PM and 4:02 PM on the same day.  The `toTZDateTime` extension was further refined and tested in  `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/test/helper/extensions/date_time_extension_test.dart` between 4:21 PM and 4:23 PM on June 26, 2025.


The initial changes to `create_edit_delegate_approval_ui_mapper.dart` involved correcting syntax errors within the `_buildFromToDateTimeField` function. Subsequent commits improved the handling of null values for 'from' and 'to' dates within the `TZDateTime` conversion.  The final changes in `create_edit_delegate_approval_ui_mapper.dart` (around 4:01 PM and later) involved importing the newly created `toTZDateTime` extension method from `common_business` and using it consistently in `_buildFromToDateTimeField` and `_buildUntilToTextField` to ensure correct timezone handling. The  `create_edit_delegate_approval_ui_mapper.dart` file remained largely unchanged outside of these date/time handling improvements.  The changes to `date_time_extension.dart` involved adding the `toTZDateTime` function for timezone conversion using the `timezone` package, initially missing the import statement and then clarifying the usage of the `timezone` library with appropriate imports. The tests for the `toTZDateTime` function were added to verify functionality and handle timezone conversions.
