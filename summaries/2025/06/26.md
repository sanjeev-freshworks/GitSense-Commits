# Activity Summary for 6/26/2025

## 3:45:41 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/core_ui/lib/src/components/datepicker/fs_date_picker.dart` file on June 26th, 2025, all between 3:09 PM and 3:10 PM.  The changes primarily focus on the `showFSDatePicker` function within this Dart file.

The initial versions (3:09:29 PM and 3:09:37 PM) had a minor typographical error corrected: a parameter `locatio` was changed to `location`.

A more significant change occurred between 3:09:37 PM and 3:09:55 PM.  The `initialDate` default value within the `showDatePicker` function was altered. It was initially set to `DateTime.now()` and changed to `TZDateTime.now(location:)`, integrating timezone functionality using the `timezone` package.

A final minor change at 3:10:05 PM involved a slight correction in the `TZDateTime.now(location:)` call, removing a stray colon, thereby finalizing the timezone integration.

Throughout the revisions, the file consistently used the `core_ui`, `flutter/material`, and `timezone` packages,  and the styling of the date picker remained consistent, applying a custom `DatePickerTheme` for color consistency.
