# Activity Summary for 6/12/2025

## 3:05:41 PM
The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/core_meta.json` file was updated on June 12, 2025, at 2:55:07 PM.  This JSON file describes a Figma design, "FSDS - Core," with a last modified date of January 15, 2025. The update appears to be metadata modification rather than changes to the design itself. The file contains detailed information about the Figma design's nodes, including  "Cover," "Logo-FS," "Logo Overlay," "Freshservice" (text), and "Design System - Core" (text) elements. These elements are described by their position, size, color, and other visual properties.  The update likely reflects a change in the metadata associated with the Figma file, such as a new thumbnail URL or version number.  There is no indication of substantive changes to the visual design itself within the provided metadata.


## 6:30:55 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a data layer code generation prompt file (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/data_layer_codegen.prompt.md`),  undergoing minor edits between 3:17:00 PM and 3:26:17 PM on June 12, 2025.  These edits appear to be refinements to the instructions and context provided within the prompt, rather than substantial structural changes.  The prompt guides code generation for a Flutter data layer based on user input, including CURL commands and JSON responses.  It outlines steps for gathering user input, confirming the details, and generating code components like API constants, request/response models, mappers, and repositories.  The instructions reference several related guideline documents located within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/data/` directory.

A markdown file outlining API to data model mapper guidelines (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/data/api_to_data_model_mapper_guidelines.instructions.md`) was also updated twice within a minute around 3:13 PM on the same day, showing no apparent change in content between those two versions. This file details rules for creating Dart extensions to map API models to data models, handling nullability, and structuring mapper methods. The file includes several examples of Dart code illustrating these guidelines.

Finally, a VS Code settings file (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.vscode/settings.json`) was modified at 3:15:10 PM, indicating configurations for a Copilot Buddy extension, defining tasks related to data and API model creation, and specifying locations for chat prompt files.
