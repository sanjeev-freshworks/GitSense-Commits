# Activity Summary for 6/5/2025

## 12:38:08 PM
The log shows code changes across several files within a Flutter project, primarily focused on creating and refining a `BannerComponent`.  The changes span from 11:47 AM to 12:12 PM on June 5th, 2025.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/screen_figma.dart`: This file contains a Dart code snippet representing a UI element, seemingly an informational banner.  The code includes styling details (colors, fonts, padding) and is updated twice, with identical content, at 11:47:09 AM and 11:51:51 AM.  No functional changes are observed between these updates.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_codegen.prompt.md`: This markdown file outlines a multi-step process for code generation, likely automated.  The process involves analyzing Figma design elements (Dart code and a Figma link), mapping colors and UI components to a consistent style guide (`core_ui`, `common_ui`), and implementing a component in the specified module. This file is updated multiple times between 11:47:20 AM and 12:06:14 PM. The main changes involve refining instructions, specifically in step 9 which focuses on color and textstyle mismatch fixing and clarifying instructions to improve accuracy and adherence to the figma design.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/info_banner/info_banner.dart`: This file defines a reusable `InfoBanner` widget.  The code uses theme-based color schemes (`context.theme.fsColorScheme`) and provides options for displaying text or rich text with an optional action button. Multiple updates occurred between 11:51:28 AM and 11:54:18 AM, resulting in  no changes to the code in the final update. This suggests a potential interruption or rollback in the development process.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/banner_component/banner_component.dart`: and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/banner_component.dart`: These files contain different versions of the `BannerComponent`, undergoing iterative refinement. The initial version uses hardcoded colors; later versions incorporate theme-based styling using `context.theme.fsColorScheme` for colors and `context.theme.fsTextTheme` for text styles. The color scheme is adjusted between 12:03:05 PM and 12:12:01 PM to match the Figma design more closely, transitioning from `context.theme.fsColorScheme.text.semantic.info` to `context.theme.fsColorScheme.text.secondary` and adjusting fill color opacity using `withOpacity(0.2)`.  The layout is also slightly adjusted, with the addition of `SizedBox` widgets for spacing.  The file path changes are possibly due to refactoring.

A common theme is the consistent use of the `fsColorScheme` and `fsTextTheme` for styling, indicating a structured approach to theme management within the application.  The multiple revisions of the `ui_codegen.prompt.md` file and the `BannerComponent` implementation suggest an iterative development process where the prompt is refined and the code is adjusted based on feedback or testing.
