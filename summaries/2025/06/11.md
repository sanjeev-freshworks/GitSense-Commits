# Activity Summary for 6/11/2025

## 11:59:26 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to a `settings.json` file and a `copilot-instructions.md` file within a Flutter project.  The `settings.json` file is configured to use a Copilot buddy for tasks related to data and API model creation, repository generation, use case development, and testing.


The  `copilot-instructions.md` file, modified multiple times between 11:38:28 AM and 11:39:00 AM, provides detailed instructions for an AI assistant.  These instructions describe the project's architecture (Clean Architecture with BLoC pattern), technologies used (Flutter, Dart, various packages), project structure (apps, features, libraries), coding conventions, testing strategies, and goals for the AI assistant (code generation respecting Clean Architecture, scaffolding new features, encouraging test-driven development).  The multiple modifications appear to be minor edits and refinements to the AI assistant instructions.


The `settings.json` file undergoes several changes between 11:37:45 AM and 11:58:46 AM.  Initially, it only defines tasks for the Copilot buddy.  Later modifications add configurations for code and test generation instructions, pointing to specific files (`.copilot-codeGeneration-instructions.md`, `.copilot-test-instructions.md`) and, at one point, a wildcard directory (`context/data/*`). There's some instability in the configuration of `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions` initially, where it is set, then unset and then reset again. The `chat.promptFilesLocations` section is also added and modified to include paths within the `.github` directory.  The final state of `settings.json` indicates the use of specified files for instructions on code and test generation, along with specifying particular folders containing prompt data.  The `copilotbuddy.tasks` array remains consistent throughout all changes, indicating a stable definition of tasks for the AI assistant.
