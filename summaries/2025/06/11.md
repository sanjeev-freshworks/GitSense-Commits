# Activity Summary for 6/11/2025

## 11:59:26 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to a `settings.json` file and a `copilot-instructions.md` file within a Flutter project.  The `settings.json` file is configured to use a Copilot buddy for tasks related to data and API model creation, repository generation, use case development, and testing.


The  `copilot-instructions.md` file, modified multiple times between 11:38:28 AM and 11:39:00 AM, provides detailed instructions for an AI assistant.  These instructions describe the project's architecture (Clean Architecture with BLoC pattern), technologies used (Flutter, Dart, various packages), project structure (apps, features, libraries), coding conventions, testing strategies, and goals for the AI assistant (code generation respecting Clean Architecture, scaffolding new features, encouraging test-driven development).  The multiple modifications appear to be minor edits and refinements to the AI assistant instructions.


The `settings.json` file undergoes several changes between 11:37:45 AM and 11:58:46 AM.  Initially, it only defines tasks for the Copilot buddy.  Later modifications add configurations for code and test generation instructions, pointing to specific files (`.copilot-codeGeneration-instructions.md`, `.copilot-test-instructions.md`) and, at one point, a wildcard directory (`context/data/*`). There's some instability in the configuration of `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions` initially, where it is set, then unset and then reset again. The `chat.promptFilesLocations` section is also added and modified to include paths within the `.github` directory.  The final state of `settings.json` indicates the use of specified files for instructions on code and test generation, along with specifying particular folders containing prompt data.  The `copilotbuddy.tasks` array remains consistent throughout all changes, indicating a stable definition of tasks for the AI assistant.


## 12:59:31 PM
The log shows a series of code changes and configuration updates primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project.  The changes span from June 11th, 2025, between approximately 11:59 AM and 12:20 PM.

One early change involved adding a "Generated by AI" tag to git commit messages.  Subsequently, several modifications were made to `.vscode/settings.json` and `.github/context/data/response_data_model_guidelines.instructions.md` files.  The `.vscode/settings.json` file was repeatedly updated to configure various settings related to Copilot Buddy tasks, instruction and prompt file locations for chat functionality.  The changes to these settings were minor iterative adjustments to file location inclusions. The final state of the `.vscode/settings.json` indicates the use of Copilot Buddy, a task management tool, integrating with the Github Copilot for AI code assistance.  The `copilotbuddy.tasks` array consistently listed steps related to data model and API generation, and use case implementation.

The  `.github/context/data/response_data_model_guidelines.instructions.md` file contains extensive guidelines for generating Dart response data models using the `freezed` package.  These guidelines detail best practices for enum creation, field type handling (nullability, data types), and file structure. The `applyTo` directive in this file was modified iteratively to refine the scope of its application, finally settling on `**/data/**`.  A similar pattern is seen in  `.github/context/data/response_api_model_guidelines.instructions.md` and `.github/context/data/api_to_data_model_mapper_guidelines.instructions.md`, showing a consistent approach to defining rules for API models and mappers. The `applyTo` directive is used to direct the guidelines to relevant files.

The `.github/prompts/data/data_layer_codegen.prompt.md` file presents a comprehensive prompt intended for AI-assisted data layer code generation. This prompt meticulously guides the user input collection process, emphasizing user confirmation and iterative refinement before code generation.

Finally, changes were made to the `approval_lib` directory within the project.  These updates modify and add files related to API constants (`approval_remote_constants.dart`), data mappers (`delegation_response_api_model_mapper.dart`), remote data source (`approval_remote_data_source.dart`), and repository (`approvals_repository.dart`). The `approval_remote_constants.dart` contains a substantial number of constants related to API endpoints.  The other files within this library appear to be related to data access and manipulation for approvals.  There were two nearly identical updates to `approval_remote_constants.dart`, suggesting a minor, perhaps unintentional, duplicate edit.

The last two entries involve updating a prompt file to generate UI code from a Figma file, providing a link to the design file.
