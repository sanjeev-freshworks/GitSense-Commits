# Activity Summary for 6/9/2025

## 12:36:00 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a UI code generation prompt and subsequent code changes within a Flutter project.  The prompt, repeatedly modified between 12:05 PM and 12:10 PM, details a multi-step process for generating UI code from Figma designs.  Key steps involve fetching Figma data (using a link and metadata file), mapping Figma colors and styles to internal components (`core_ui`, `common_ui`), implementing the component, showcasing it, and meticulously verifying the color and style mappings.  The repeated edits to the prompt suggest refinement and clarification of the instructions.

Around 12:30 PM, updates occurred in the `fs_ui_catalog_app` module.  An enum `FreshserviceComponentsElements` was created or updated (no content change between the two timestamps) and a `FreshserviceComponentsScreen` was added to list and navigate to different Freshservice components.

Finally, between 12:34 PM and 12:35 PM, the `ApprovalListItemContent` component was significantly altered in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/approval_list_item_content.dart`. The main change involved updating the `approvableType` parameter type from `ApprovableType` to `ApprovalType`, indicating a potential model refactoring.  The component itself renders approval list items based on provided data, using custom UI components from `core_ui` and `common_ui`.


## 1:36:06 PM
The log shows iterative development of a Flutter `BannerComponent`.  The primary file modified is `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/banner_component.dart`.

Initially (6/9/2025, 12:36:43 PM), the file focused on an `ApprovalListItemContent` component, detailing its structure and interactions, using custom widgets like `FSCard`, `FSImage`, `FSOutlineButton`, and `FSPrimaryButton`.

Subsequent changes (between 12:37:01 PM and 12:47:59 PM) significantly restructured `ApprovalListItemContent`.  `FSCard` was replaced with a standard `Card` with customized styling.  `FSImage` widgets were replaced with `Icon` widgets,  and custom buttons were replaced with `OutlinedButton.icon` and `ElevatedButton.icon`.  The `_buildPriorityTag` function was refined to use more precise color definitions, using `context.theme.fsColorScheme`. The `ApprovalType` enum is used to differentiate the type of approval (ticket or change). The `PriorityModel` determines the color and styling of the priority tag.

Around 12:45 PM,  `Semantics` were added to improve accessibility, providing labels and hints for screen readers.

The final version (12:47:59 PM) of `ApprovalListItemContent` uses a cleaner approach to setting colors in `_buildPriorityTag` by introducing a `priorityLevel` enum and a `switch` statement.  There were no significant changes after this timestamp for `ApprovalListItemContent`.

A new `BannerComponent` was introduced later (from 1:00:27 PM onwards).   It started as a simple banner displaying a delegated approval message but evolved to include different types (`BannerType` enum: `info`, `success`, `warning`, `error`), an optional icon, trailing widget, tap action, and custom padding.  The color scheme dynamically changed based on the `BannerType`. The final `BannerComponent` utilizes a structured approach with a `TextSpan` to display different parts of the message with varying styles. The `FSBanner` widget is later introduced to manage styling and color. There are multiple revisions for this component before final version.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_codegen.prompt.md` file was updated several times (between 12:54:36 PM and 1:13:34 PM), suggesting a process of refining code generation instructions.  The steps remained mostly consistent, focusing on a structured process for translating Figma designs into Flutter code using a predefined set of UI components and color schemes.

The `FreshserviceComponentsElements` enum was created and remained unchanged during its recorded updates, adding `attachmentPicker` and `banner`.


In summary, the code changes show a progression from a basic approval item display to a more robust and customizable approval list item and a flexible banner component, consistently applying a themed design system with thorough testing.  The frequent updates to the code generation prompt suggests an ongoing refinement of the UI code generation process.


## 2:36:03 PM
The log shows code changes across multiple files within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project.  The primary focus is on the development and refinement of a `BannerComponent`.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/banner_component.dart` file underwent several revisions between 1:36 PM and 1:38 PM on June 9th, 2025.  These changes appear to be minor edits or possibly formatting adjustments, as the code content remains largely the same across these timestamps. The file displays different banner types (info, success, warning, error) using a custom `FSBanner` widget.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/banner/banner_component.dart` file was modified several times between 1:42 PM and 2:10 PM on June 9th, 2025.  The significant changes involved adding optional parameters `buttonText` and `onButtonPressed` to the `BannerComponent` class, allowing for an optional button within the banner.  The initial versions only displayed a message with styling based on `FSColorScheme`.  The final revision added the button, conditionally rendering it based on the presence of `buttonText` and `onButtonPressed`. The `withOpacity` function was added to adjust opacity.



The `.github/prompts/ui/ui_codegen.prompt.md` file was modified multiple times between 1:38 PM and 2:20 PM on June 9th, 2025. These revisions refined the steps for UI code generation.  The prompt details a comprehensive process, including instructions for fetching Figma data, mapping UI components and colors to the project's design system (`core_ui` and `common_ui` modules), meticulous color and style verification, and component implementation and showcase. The main change throughout these edits focuses on clarifying instructions and emphasizing strict adherence to guidelines to ensure consistent and accurate code generation.  The emphasis is on precise color matching and style consistency.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/screen_figma.dart` file experienced several updates between 1:56 PM and 2:11 PM on June 9th, 2025.  These changes appear insignificant, if any.  The file contains the original Flutter code extracted from a Figma design, containing color comments which are referenced in the `ui_codegen.prompt.md` file.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/screen_figma_metadata.yml` file had its code altered between 1:54 PM and 2:20 PM on June 9th, 2025.  The file contains metadata about the Figma design, notably corrected a typo in `'27692:1573'` from `TEXT` to `textStyle` to reflect its contents accurately.


Finally, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/core_meta.yml` file was updated at 2:26 PM on June 9th, 2025. This file holds metadata related to the core design system, seemingly unrelated to the banner component development.  It contains Figma design token information.


## 3:36:01 PM
The log shows several modifications to two JSON files related to UI design, specifically `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/screen_figma.json` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/core_meta.json`.


The `/screen_figma.json` file underwent multiple revisions.  The first entry (3:04:32 PM) contains a detailed description of a "Message" frame and a "Button" instance, specifying dimensions, colors, text content ("Your approvals are delegated to John Smith until 16 Jun 2025, 12:00PM."), and styling using both absolute values and Tailwind CSS classes. A later entry (3:06:55 PM) briefly overwrites the file, replacing the content with empty arrays for grid systems, font styles, and colors.  Subsequently, at 3:23:18 PM and again at 3:28:22 PM, the file is updated with a comprehensive Figma file export, including nested objects defining nodes, components, component sets, and styles.  The structure is significantly more complex, leveraging Figma's internal ID system and referencing style definitions.  The last two updates are identical.

The `/core_meta.json` file was updated once (3:05:27 PM) with a similar Figma export structure as the later entries in `/screen_figma.json`. This file describes design tokens, including labels for "TEXT," "Icon," "Fill & BG," "Overlay," and "Boundary," alongside color swatches, illustrating a design system's core elements.  A later update at 3:24:11 PM provides a more complete Figma export with  similar structure to the final versions of `/screen_figma.json`.

In summary, the changes reflect an iterative process of designing and exporting UI elements from Figma.  The initial versions of both JSON files contained simplified representations, while the final versions are rich with detailed information from the Figma design file.  The repeated updates in `/screen_figma.json` suggest potential issues or refinements during the export process, ultimately resulting in the complete and consistent export of the Figma design file.  Both files use Figma's internal variable referencing ("VariableID:...") extensively.


## 4:36:07 PM
The provided log shows two updates to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/core_meta.json`, a JSON file seemingly describing a UI design system.  Both updates occurred on June 9th, 2025, with a very short time interval between them (3:37:09 PM and 3:37:32 PM).  The changes are minimal, only affecting the formatting and structure of the JSON data itself.  The content of the design system, including color palettes, text styles, and vector graphics, remains largely the same across both versions. The second JSON is a truncated version of the first. There's no evidence of significant functional changes in the design system itself, rather it appears to be a minor adjustment to the JSON file.
