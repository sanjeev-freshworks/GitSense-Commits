# Activity Summary for 6/9/2025

## 12:36:00 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a UI code generation prompt and subsequent code changes within a Flutter project.  The prompt, repeatedly modified between 12:05 PM and 12:10 PM, details a multi-step process for generating UI code from Figma designs.  Key steps involve fetching Figma data (using a link and metadata file), mapping Figma colors and styles to internal components (`core_ui`, `common_ui`), implementing the component, showcasing it, and meticulously verifying the color and style mappings.  The repeated edits to the prompt suggest refinement and clarification of the instructions.

Around 12:30 PM, updates occurred in the `fs_ui_catalog_app` module.  An enum `FreshserviceComponentsElements` was created or updated (no content change between the two timestamps) and a `FreshserviceComponentsScreen` was added to list and navigate to different Freshservice components.

Finally, between 12:34 PM and 12:35 PM, the `ApprovalListItemContent` component was significantly altered in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/approval_list_item_content.dart`. The main change involved updating the `approvableType` parameter type from `ApprovableType` to `ApprovalType`, indicating a potential model refactoring.  The component itself renders approval list items based on provided data, using custom UI components from `core_ui` and `common_ui`.


## 1:36:06 PM
The log shows iterative development of a Flutter `BannerComponent`.  The primary file modified is `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/banner_component.dart`.

Initially (6/9/2025, 12:36:43 PM), the file focused on an `ApprovalListItemContent` component, detailing its structure and interactions, using custom widgets like `FSCard`, `FSImage`, `FSOutlineButton`, and `FSPrimaryButton`.

Subsequent changes (between 12:37:01 PM and 12:47:59 PM) significantly restructured `ApprovalListItemContent`.  `FSCard` was replaced with a standard `Card` with customized styling.  `FSImage` widgets were replaced with `Icon` widgets,  and custom buttons were replaced with `OutlinedButton.icon` and `ElevatedButton.icon`.  The `_buildPriorityTag` function was refined to use more precise color definitions, using `context.theme.fsColorScheme`. The `ApprovalType` enum is used to differentiate the type of approval (ticket or change). The `PriorityModel` determines the color and styling of the priority tag.

Around 12:45 PM,  `Semantics` were added to improve accessibility, providing labels and hints for screen readers.

The final version (12:47:59 PM) of `ApprovalListItemContent` uses a cleaner approach to setting colors in `_buildPriorityTag` by introducing a `priorityLevel` enum and a `switch` statement.  There were no significant changes after this timestamp for `ApprovalListItemContent`.

A new `BannerComponent` was introduced later (from 1:00:27 PM onwards).   It started as a simple banner displaying a delegated approval message but evolved to include different types (`BannerType` enum: `info`, `success`, `warning`, `error`), an optional icon, trailing widget, tap action, and custom padding.  The color scheme dynamically changed based on the `BannerType`. The final `BannerComponent` utilizes a structured approach with a `TextSpan` to display different parts of the message with varying styles. The `FSBanner` widget is later introduced to manage styling and color. There are multiple revisions for this component before final version.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_codegen.prompt.md` file was updated several times (between 12:54:36 PM and 1:13:34 PM), suggesting a process of refining code generation instructions.  The steps remained mostly consistent, focusing on a structured process for translating Figma designs into Flutter code using a predefined set of UI components and color schemes.

The `FreshserviceComponentsElements` enum was created and remained unchanged during its recorded updates, adding `attachmentPicker` and `banner`.


In summary, the code changes show a progression from a basic approval item display to a more robust and customizable approval list item and a flexible banner component, consistently applying a themed design system with thorough testing.  The frequent updates to the code generation prompt suggests an ongoing refinement of the UI code generation process.
