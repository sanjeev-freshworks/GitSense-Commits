# Activity Summary for 6/9/2025

## 12:36:00 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a UI code generation prompt and subsequent code changes within a Flutter project.  The prompt, repeatedly modified between 12:05 PM and 12:10 PM, details a multi-step process for generating UI code from Figma designs.  Key steps involve fetching Figma data (using a link and metadata file), mapping Figma colors and styles to internal components (`core_ui`, `common_ui`), implementing the component, showcasing it, and meticulously verifying the color and style mappings.  The repeated edits to the prompt suggest refinement and clarification of the instructions.

Around 12:30 PM, updates occurred in the `fs_ui_catalog_app` module.  An enum `FreshserviceComponentsElements` was created or updated (no content change between the two timestamps) and a `FreshserviceComponentsScreen` was added to list and navigate to different Freshservice components.

Finally, between 12:34 PM and 12:35 PM, the `ApprovalListItemContent` component was significantly altered in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/approval_list_item_content.dart`. The main change involved updating the `approvableType` parameter type from `ApprovableType` to `ApprovalType`, indicating a potential model refactoring.  The component itself renders approval list items based on provided data, using custom UI components from `core_ui` and `common_ui`.
