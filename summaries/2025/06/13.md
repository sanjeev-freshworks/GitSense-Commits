# Activity Summary for 6/13/2025

## 12:19:20 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a markdown file (`data_layer_codegen.md`) detailing instructions for generating Flutter data layer code from user input.  The key updates revolve around refining the instructions and clarifying the file paths for related guideline documents.

The initial version (11:55:24 AM) provides a comprehensive guide encompassing user input gathering, parsing, confirmation, and code generation steps.  It specifies the types of information required from the user for a CRUD API operation, including module details, request details (CURL command, enum parameters, etc.), and response details (JSON response, mandatory and default fields, enums, date/time fields). It also outlines a confirmation checklist for user review and defines rules for API constant generation.  The file includes links to several other guideline markdown files for additional context.

Subsequent revisions (11:55:34 AM, 11:55:45 AM, 11:55:57 AM, 11:57:26 AM, 11:57:48 AM) primarily focus on correcting and improving the relative paths to the context files mentioned at the end of the document.  These changes are incremental, with each revision slightly adjusting or simplifying the file paths.  The core instruction content remains largely unchanged across these revisions.

Finally, a distinct file named `data_layer_codegen.prompt.md` (11:59:12 AM) appears, seemingly a revised version aimed at improving clarity or for use as a prompt, as it shares nearly identical content to the previous iterations of `data_layer_codegen.md`.  The only noteworthy difference seems to be in the organization and presentation for better readability. The overall structure and instructions for generating Flutter data layer code remain constant across all versions.

The log shows three consecutive updates to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/ui/route/approval_lib_routes_builder.dart` between 1:27:05 PM and 1:27:27 PM on June 13, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor edits; the code remains largely the same across all three revisions.  The file defines route builders for various approval-related screens within a Flutter application using the `go_router` package. Each route builder handles different parameters and navigates to specific screens such as `ApprovalListScreen`, `ApprovalDetailScreen`, `ApprovalChainListScreen`, `CreateEditApprovalSetsScreen`, `TicketApprovalGroupDetailScreen`, `ChangeApprovalGroupDetailScreen`, and `CreateEditDelegateApprovalScreen`.  The updates likely involve minor refactoring or typo corrections, as the core functionality and structure of the route builders stay consistent across the revisions.  No significant functional changes are observable from the provided diffs.
