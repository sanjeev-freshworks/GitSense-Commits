# Activity Summary for 6/20/2025

## 12:19:57 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, specifically within the `common_business` module.  The changes span from 11:32 AM to 12:18 PM on June 20, 2025.

The initial changes (11:32 AM - 11:35 AM) involve modifying a prompt file (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md`). This file contains prompts for code generation related to a data layer. The prompt is iteratively refined, changing the input from using "C:" to "CURL", and adjusting the API response details provided as input to the prompt.

Between 11:35 AM and 11:39 AM, further iterations of the prompt file modify the API response input, initially providing a JSON response, then specifying to ignore certain fields (`contract_privilege` and `helpdesk_agent`), and lastly changing file naming conventions in the notes section, including replacing `approval_remote_constants.dart` with `common_remote_constants.dart` and changing the repository file names from `approvals_repository.dart` to `common_lib_repository.dart`.

At 11:41 AM, a Dart file (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/core_lib/lib/src/data/model/response/autocomplete_agent_and_requester.dart`) is created and then subsequently cleared, suggesting an initial attempt at defining a data model that was later discarded or moved.

From 11:42 AM to 11:43 AM, the prompt file is updated again, adding instructions to make optional fields nullable.  The changes to the prompt file directly impacted subsequent Dart file modifications.

At 11:45 AM, the `common_remote_constants.dart` file is modified to include `API Params` such as `q` for query parameters, reflecting a change in how API calls are handled, likely to align with changes specified in the prompts.  This file defines API endpoints for various functionalities, including agent and requester searches, attachment handling, and language translation.

Subsequent modifications (11:46 AM - 11:53 AM) involve creating and updating several mapper files in the `common_business` library, converting API models to data models (`agents_and_requesters_api_model_mapper.dart`, `agents_and_requesters_group_api_model_mapper.dart`).  This section shows a consistent pattern of data model mapping from API responses to domain models.

Finally, from 11:53 AM onward, there are further model and mapper modifications. The `AgentsAndRequesters` model is updated to use Freezed for efficient data handling.  The  `get_search_agents_and_requesters_query_mapper` file is modified to explicitly define a constant string for the query parameter. Multiple versions of this mapper file exist in the log, showing further refinement in handling query parameters.  There's also the creation of an enum (`AgentsAndRequestersType`) to categorize agents and requesters.  The log concludes with the finalization of the `AgentsAndRequestersChildApiModel` which is used to represent a group of agents and requesters.

In summary, the log documents a development process involving iterative refinement of API calls, data models, and mappers for the `common_business` module, likely driven by the evolving specifications in the code generation prompts.  The most significant changes cluster around 11:35 AM and 11:42 AM with respect to the prompt file. The majority of the changes were made in `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/common_remote_data_source.dart` this file between 11:47 AM and 11:52 AM.


## 1:19:49 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business` directory.  The main focus of the changes is on the `SearchAgentsAndRequestersUseCase` class, which appears to be a use case for searching agents and requesters within the Freshservice application.

Initially, the `search_agents_and_requesters.dart` file undergoes several revisions between 12:24 PM and 12:24 PM with minor formatting and import changes.  The class itself remains largely unchanged during this period.

Around 12:25 PM, a new file `search_agents_and_requesters_use_case.dart` is introduced, containing almost identical code to the previous file.  This file is then heavily modified throughout the log.  Specifically:

*   Between 12:25 PM and 12:32 PM, the `call` method is renamed to `protectedExecute` and the parameter type changes from `SearchAgentsAndRequestersParams` to `String`.  Importantly, the implementation is updated to use `GetSearchAgentsAndRequestersQuery` to construct the query parameter, showing a shift towards a more structured approach to querying.  The addition of `async`/`await` indicates a change to asynchronous operation. Finally, the return value is sorted using the `sortedBy` method from the `collection` package based on the `text?.value` property of `AgentsAndRequesters` objects.
*   The file is also updated to import necessary packages like `collection` for sorting and `common_business` and `core` packages related to data models and use-case implementation.

Concurrently, test files (`search_agents_and_requesters_use_case_test.dart`) undergo several revisions reflecting the name changes and structure modifications in the main `use_case` file.  There are several renaming attempts visible in the test files' evolution.

Between 1:09 PM and 1:10 PM, the `common_business.dart` file is updated. This file is a library file which exports a large number of Dart files related to various data models, data sources, use cases and helper functions. This suggests a significant refactoring or reorganization of the projectâ€™s common business logic.

Finally, helper files for test cases (`search_agents_and_requesters_expected_io.dart`) are modified between 1:14 PM and 1:19 PM to provide expected input and output data for the tests, mirroring the changes made in the `SearchAgentsAndRequestersUseCase`. The final version includes a more comprehensive set of expected data, showcasing the successful implementation of the search functionality with detailed sample data.  The final commit at 1:19 PM demonstrates the completion of this refactoring, with a successful test of the `searchAgentsAndRequestersUseCase`.

In summary, the log illustrates a significant refactoring of the search agents and requesters use case, improving code organization, query structure and the addition of test cases to verify the correctness of the implementation.  The use of asynchronous operations and the `collection` package for efficient sorting are key improvements.  The timestamp range of significant changes is between 12:25 PM and 1:19 PM, with the bulk of work concentrated in `search_agents_and_requesters_use_case.dart` and associated test files.
