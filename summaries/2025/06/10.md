# Activity Summary for 6/10/2025

## 12:31:16 PM
The log shows three entries related to code generation for a Flutter data layer.  All entries are from June 10th, 2025.

The first entry (12:23:15 PM) details a prompt, `data_layer_codegen.prompt.md`,  that outlines a comprehensive process for generating this data layer.  This process involves gathering user input (module details, CURL command, response details, including enums and date/time fields), parsing that input to extract relevant information (HTTP method, API path, etc.), presenting a confirmation checklist for user review and editing, and finally generating code components step-by-step (API constants, request/response models, mappers, data sources, and repositories).  The prompt also references several guideline files for context.  An example is provided using the `ticket` module.

The second and third entries (12:25:19 PM and 12:25:30 PM) are nearly identical. They instruct to run the `data_layer_codegen` prompt with specific input for the `approval_lib` module. This input includes API information sourced from several files (note that these file paths are not summarized as they potentially contain sensitive information), a JSON request body, and specifications regarding mandatory fields, date/time fields, and file naming conventions for generated code components (e.g.,  `approval_remote_constants.dart`, `approvals_repository.dart`).  The key difference is that the second entry includes a request body while the third one doesn't.  Both entries focus only on the "Get Delegation Detail" API endpoint for both requester and agent.
