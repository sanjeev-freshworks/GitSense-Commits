# Activity Summary for 6/10/2025

## 12:31:16 PM
The log shows three entries related to code generation for a Flutter data layer.  All entries are from June 10th, 2025.

The first entry (12:23:15 PM) details a prompt, `data_layer_codegen.prompt.md`,  that outlines a comprehensive process for generating this data layer.  This process involves gathering user input (module details, CURL command, response details, including enums and date/time fields), parsing that input to extract relevant information (HTTP method, API path, etc.), presenting a confirmation checklist for user review and editing, and finally generating code components step-by-step (API constants, request/response models, mappers, data sources, and repositories).  The prompt also references several guideline files for context.  An example is provided using the `ticket` module.

The second and third entries (12:25:19 PM and 12:25:30 PM) are nearly identical. They instruct to run the `data_layer_codegen` prompt with specific input for the `approval_lib` module. This input includes API information sourced from several files (note that these file paths are not summarized as they potentially contain sensitive information), a JSON request body, and specifications regarding mandatory fields, date/time fields, and file naming conventions for generated code components (e.g.,  `approval_remote_constants.dart`, `approvals_repository.dart`).  The key difference is that the second entry includes a request body while the third one doesn't.  Both entries focus only on the "Get Delegation Detail" API endpoint for both requester and agent.


## 6:48:02 PM
The log shows modifications to two files between 2:43 PM and 2:54 PM on June 10, 2025.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` was updated at 2:43:16 PM.  This file contains a large number of key-value pairs representing localized strings for an approval system. The keys suggest functionality related to approvals, including actions (approve, reject, cancel), status updates, user notifications, and various UI elements.  The strings are extensively parameterized using curly braces (`{}`) for dynamic content insertion, particularly dates, counts, and user names.  There's a significant amount of text related to approval workflows and user interaction with them.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice_copy/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/features/requester/details/ticket_detail_validation_test.dart` underwent multiple changes between 2:53 PM and 2:54 PM. This Dart file appears to contain unit tests for a ticket detail validation feature.  The code uses a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) framework (evidenced by `bdd_steps` in import statements).  The tests focus on verifying ticket navigation and information display for requesters.  Specifically, there are tests (commented out in the later commits) for viewing ticket lists, navigating to ticket details pages, and verifying ticket information display, possibly based on ticket ID.  The test suite is structured using the `testWidgets` function from the Flutter testing framework.  There were three commits to this file, with the second and third successively commenting out the test cases present in the first commit.
