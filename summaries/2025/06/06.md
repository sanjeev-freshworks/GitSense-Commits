# Activity Summary for 6/6/2025

## 3:31:09 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Flutter `BannerComponent` and a lengthy UI code generation prompt.

The `banner_component.dart` file underwent several revisions between 2:36 PM and 2:40 PM on June 6th, 2025.  These revisions primarily focused on refining the styling of the action button within the banner, initially using a `textStyle` property and later removing it because the `FSPlainButton` already applied the desired styling. The content of the file remained largely consistent, with the core functionality—displaying a message with an optional action button—unchanged.

A separate `banner_component.dart` file under `/src/components/freshservice/view/components/` was created and significantly developed between 2:45 PM and 3:09 PM on June 6th, 2025. This version introduced a more comprehensive banner component with support for different banner types (`info`, `success`, `warning`, `error`), custom icons, and dismiss functionality.  The color scheme dynamically adapts based on the banner type, utilizing `FSColorScheme`.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_codegen.prompt.md` file was modified multiple times between 2:40 PM and 3:03 PM on June 6th, 2025.  These modifications primarily involved clarifying instructions and emphasis on meticulous attention to detail. The prompt outlines a comprehensive process for generating UI components in Flutter, focusing on mapping Figma designs to a consistent internal component library (`core_ui`, `common_ui`).  The instructions emphasize the importance of precise color and text style mapping, and exhaustive verification steps. The repeated edits suggest a refinement of the prompt to ensure clarity and prevent ambiguity in the code generation process.  The process includes fetching Figma design data, analyzing code, and implementing components while strictly adhering to style guidelines.  There are multiple references to external guideline files.
