# Activity Summary for 6/3/2025

## 9:55:54 AM
The log shows repeated modifications to a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/delegation_api_response.g.dart`.  This file appears to be automatically generated (indicated by "// GENERATED CODE - DO NOT MODIFY BY HAND"). The core code within the file remains consistent throughout all changes.  The only variations are in a trailing comment section added after the generated code.

The changes to the comment section began at 9:41:47 AM on June 3rd, 2025,  and continued with minor additions until 9:52:34 AM on the same day. The changes mostly involve adding names (initially just Ayush, then Abhishek Shukla, Sourik Ganguly, and Dharmendra Kumar), and finally "box8" and "swiggy".  There was a brief period of inactivity between 9:42:28 AM and 9:46:55 AM.  The final version of the comment section includes all the names and "box8" and "swiggy".  The core JSON serialization/deserialization code within the file did not change.  The modifications appear to be unrelated to the file's main function.

The log details code changes related to UI code generation in a Flutter project.  Several files contain guidelines and instructions for this process.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_codegen.prompt.md` outlines a six-step process for UI code generation.  This prompt repeatedly emphasizes the importance of following steps accurately and without deviation. It involves fetching data from a Figma link, analyzing existing UI elements, and implementing a new component using existing `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules. Multiple edits to this file adjusted file paths used for referencing guideline documents.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/showcase_new_screen.instructions.md` describes how to add a newly created view component to the `fs_ui_catalog_app` module.  This involves adding exports, enum values, and a new catalog screen.  The file path within this file was adjusted multiple times to maintain proper reference to other modules.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/ui_codegen_guidelines.instructions.md` provides detailed guidelines for mapping UI components and colors from Figma designs to the project's existing components. It specifies using `core_ui` and `common_ui` components, following design consistency, adhering to clean architecture principles, and utilizing theme-driven design.  This file was also repeatedly edited throughout the log, suggesting a refinement process for the guidelines.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/ui_color_mapping_guidelines.instructions.md` offers a mapping table for translating Figma color tokens to the project's `FSColorScheme`.  This table lists Figma tokens, their corresponding paths in `FSColorScheme`, and their hex values for light and dark modes.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/ui_typography_mapping.instructions.md` maps Figma typography styles to the `FSTextTheme` in the `core_ui` module.  It specifies using existing text styles based on font weights and sizes defined within the `FSTextTheme` object.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/screen_figma.dart` contains Flutter code copied directly from Figma. This code snippet shows a `Container` with specific styling, a `Text.rich` element to display multi-styled text, and a smaller `Container` containing a "Manage" button. This file undergoes several revisions, with the commented-out sections possibly representing different stages of code evolution or experimentation.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/component/banner_component.dart` shows the implementation of a "BannerComponent" widget.  The initial implementation uses custom styles and `FSPlainButton`.  Subsequent edits involve using a `TextButton` instead of `FSPlainButton`, and then back to using `FSPlainButton` within a `Container`. Finally, the styling is adjusted for better integration with the existing theme, and a `Container` is used to wrap the `FSPlainButton`.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/freshservice_components_screen.dart` demonstrates a screen showcasing different Freshservice components, including `AttachmentPickerComponent` and finally `BannerComponent`, using a `ListView` to display them.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/banner/view/banner_component.dart` presents a more refined version of `BannerComponent` with parameters for delegate name and date, which makes it more reusable and flexible than the earlier implementations. The structure, however, remains very similar to previous iterations.

The overall pattern shows an iterative process of refining UI code generation guidelines, implementing a new component based on Figma design and incorporating feedback into multiple file revisions. The multiple edits to the `ui_codegen.prompt.md` and `showcase_new_screen.instructions.md` files, particularly the adjustment of file paths, indicate troubleshooting and refining the process of incorporating the new component.
