# Activity Summary for 6/3/2025

## 9:55:54 AM
The log shows repeated modifications to a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/delegation_api_response.g.dart`.  This file appears to be automatically generated (indicated by "// GENERATED CODE - DO NOT MODIFY BY HAND"). The core code within the file remains consistent throughout all changes.  The only variations are in a trailing comment section added after the generated code.

The changes to the comment section began at 9:41:47 AM on June 3rd, 2025,  and continued with minor additions until 9:52:34 AM on the same day. The changes mostly involve adding names (initially just Ayush, then Abhishek Shukla, Sourik Ganguly, and Dharmendra Kumar), and finally "box8" and "swiggy".  There was a brief period of inactivity between 9:42:28 AM and 9:46:55 AM.  The final version of the comment section includes all the names and "box8" and "swiggy".  The core JSON serialization/deserialization code within the file did not change.  The modifications appear to be unrelated to the file's main function.
