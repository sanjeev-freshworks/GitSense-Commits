The changes mostly involve adding names (initially just Ayush, then Abhishek Shukla, Sourik Ganguly, and Dharmendra Kumar), and finally "box8" and "swiggy".  There was a brief period of inactivity between 9:42:28 AM and 9:46:55 AM.  The final version of the comment section includes all the names and "box8" and "swiggy".  The core JSON serialization/deserialization code within the file did not change.  The modifications appear to be unrelated to the file's main function.


## 11:46:10 AM
The log details code changes related to UI code generation in a Flutter project.  Several files contain guidelines and instructions for this process.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_codegen.prompt.md` outlines a six-step process for UI code generation.  This prompt repeatedly emphasizes the importance of following steps accurately and without deviation. It involves fetching data from a Figma link, analyzing existing UI elements, and implementing a new component using existing `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules. Multiple edits to this file adjusted file paths used for referencing guideline documents.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/showcase_new_screen.instructions.md` describes how to add a newly created view component to the `fs_ui_catalog_app` module.  This involves adding exports, enum values, and a new catalog screen.  The file path within this file was adjusted multiple times to maintain proper reference to other modules.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/ui_codegen_guidelines.instructions.md` provides detailed guidelines for mapping UI components and colors from Figma designs to the project's existing components. It specifies using `core_ui` and `common_ui` components, following design consistency, adhering to clean architecture principles, and utilizing theme-driven design.  This file was also repeatedly edited throughout the log, suggesting a refinement process for the guidelines.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/ui_color_mapping_guidelines.instructions.md` offers a mapping table for translating Figma color tokens to the project's `FSColorScheme`.  This table lists Figma tokens, their corresponding paths in `FSColorScheme`, and their hex values for light and dark modes.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/ui_typography_mapping.instructions.md` maps Figma typography styles to the `FSTextTheme` in the `core_ui` module.  It specifies using existing text styles based on font weights and sizes defined within the `FSTextTheme` object.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/screen_figma.dart` contains Flutter code copied directly from Figma. This code snippet shows a `Container` with specific styling, a `Text.rich` element to display multi-styled text, and a smaller `Container` containing a "Manage" button. This file undergoes several revisions, with the commented-out sections possibly representing different stages of code evolution or experimentation.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/component/banner_component.dart` shows the implementation of a "BannerComponent" widget.  The initial implementation uses custom styles and `FSPlainButton`.  Subsequent edits involve using a `TextButton` instead of `FSPlainButton`, and then back to using `FSPlainButton` within a `Container`. Finally, the styling is adjusted for better integration with the existing theme, and a `Container` is used to wrap the `FSPlainButton`.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/freshservice_components_screen.dart` demonstrates a screen showcasing different Freshservice components, including `AttachmentPickerComponent` and finally `BannerComponent`, using a `ListView` to display them.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/banner/view/banner_component.dart` presents a more refined version of `BannerComponent` with parameters for delegate name and date, which makes it more reusable and flexible than the earlier implementations. The structure, however, remains very similar to previous iterations.

The overall pattern shows an iterative process of refining UI code generation guidelines, implementing a new component based on Figma design and incorporating feedback into multiple file revisions. The multiple edits to the `ui_codegen.prompt.md` and `showcase_new_screen.instructions.md` files, particularly the adjustment of file paths, indicate troubleshooting and refining the process of incorporating the new component.


## 2:43:36 PM
The log shows multiple updates to several files within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, primarily focusing on a `BannerComponent`.

The earliest changes (around 11:47 AM) involve the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/banner/view/banner_component.dart` file, indicating initial work on the banner component.  There is no content provided for this initial version.

Between 11:48 AM and 12:03 PM, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_codegen.prompt.md` file undergoes numerous revisions.  These revisions refine a multi-step prompt for code generation, focusing on using existing UI components from `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules and adhering to specific style guidelines. The modifications primarily clarify instructions for color mapping, emphasizing the use of exact color token names from comments in provided Dart code and referencing a color mapping guideline document.  There's a clear intention to automate UI component creation based on Figma designs.

At 11:49 AM, a `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/screen_figma.dart` file appears, containing Dart code copied from a Figma design,  showing a banner with a message about approval delegation and a "Manage" button.  The code uses hardcoded color values with comments indicating color roles (e.g., `/* Color-Overlay-Semantic-Info */`).

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/ui_color_mapping_guidelines.instructions.md` file (updated at 11:54 AM, 11:54:20 AM, 12:05:58 PM, 12:06:17 PM, 1:55:45 PM, 1:56:22 PM, 1:57:08 PM, and 2:10:35 PM, 2:11:51 PM) contains a table mapping Figma color tokens to the project's color scheme (`FSColorScheme`).  The file shows  multiple revisions, with the later versions changing the format slightly for better readability and clarifying the mapping to prevent ambiguity.


Between 11:58 AM and 12:00 PM, the `banner_component.dart` file is moved from the `banner` subdirectory to the `freshservice` subdirectory and is significantly reworked to use the project's theme and color scheme instead of hardcoded values.  Multiple minor revisions refine the code during this period.  Eventually, around 2:20 PM, this file is further simplified, accepting a `Widget` as `content` instead of individual text and date strings.


From 2:00 PM onward, the `banner_component.dart` file is significantly revised in multiple iterations, simplifying its structure and improving the integration with the project's theming system (`core_ui`).   The final version (around 2:23 PM) uses `ShapeDecoration` and `RoundedRectangleBorder` for styling.

Finally, a `banner_component_catalog_screen.dart` file is added at 2:15 PM to showcase the BannerComponent.  This file undergoes several updates, primarily involving correcting import statements and fixing a typo. The final version demonstrates two instances of the BannerComponent.  The snackbar call is changed to use `buildFSSnackBar` and a corrected call to `FSSnackBar.show`.

The overall pattern indicates an iterative process of:
1.  Creating a basic `BannerComponent`.
2.  Defining a detailed code generation prompt.
3.  Refining the color mapping guidelines.
4.  Implementing and refining the `BannerComponent` to use the project's theme and style guidelines.
5.  Creating a catalog screen for demonstrating the component.

The changes show a strong emphasis on code consistency, adherence to style guidelines, and the use of internal components to maintain a coherent design system across the application.


## 3:43:31 PM
The log shows code changes across several files within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project.  The most significant changes are related to a `BannerComponent`.  Initially,  `banner_component.dart` (multiple entries with minor variations between 2:43 PM and 2:44 PM) undergoes slight modifications, mainly affecting the  `infoMild` color scheme access within  `BorderSide`.  Later, a more substantial update occurs  to `banner_component.dart` at approximately 2:52 PM, replacing the original component with a version that uses `message` and `actionText` strings instead of `TextSpan` and introduces  `onActionPressed`.

Between 2:48 PM and 2:50 PM, `ui_color_mapping_guidelines.instructions.md` is repeatedly updated. These updates seem to focus on minor formatting and possibly correcting typos or inconsistencies within the color mapping table, resulting in more consistent naming conventions for `fsColorScheme` paths (e.g., using `.mild` instead of `Mild` in certain paths).  There are no fundamental changes to the color mapping itself.


Subsequently, from 2:52 PM onwards, the focus shifts to  `banner_component.dart` within the `fs_ui_catalog_app` module. The `BannerComponent` is extensively revised multiple times (between 2:52 PM and 3:13 PM), evolving from a simple structure to a more robust component with clear documentation and an `onManagePressed` callback. It is changed to be a stateful widget at 3:24 PM then back to stateless at 3:29 PM.  Around 3:10 PM, a `BannerComponentScreen` is added for showcasing this component, indicating a completion of the banner component implementation.  Several minor edits were made during this time.

At 3:31 PM  `screen_figma.dart` was updated with code extracted from Figma. It contains a  Flutter UI implementation derived from a Figma design. The code snippet focuses on a screen displaying approval delegation details with various text elements and styling.  The  `screen_figma.dart` file is edited repeatedly (around 3:31 PM and 3:32 PM). These edits primarily involve refining comments and clarifying the purpose of the copied code.

Finally, an `ApprovalDetailComponent` is created at roughly 3:34 PM and further refined with minor edits in `approval_detail_component.dart`, showing a basic structure built using the `core_ui` components. The `ui_codegen.prompt.md` file is also updated multiple times between 3:08 PM and 3:38 PM primarily refining step 4 to emphasize the need to use exact Figma tokens, proper text styles and to include hex values with opacity.  An `ApprovalDetail` widget is created and enhanced at around 3:40 PM - 3:42 PM in `approval_detail.dart` to display approval delegation details.


The overall pattern reveals an iterative development process, with numerous minor adjustments to Dart code and Markdown documentation.  The main thrust involves designing and implementing a banner component and an approval detail component in the Freshservice mobile application, incorporating design specifications and color schemes from Figma.


## 4:43:23 PM
The log shows several code changes across three different Dart files within a Flutter project on June 3rd, 2025.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/screen_figma.dart` file underwent two nearly identical updates within a minute (3:47 PM).  These updates appear to be copies of UI code from Figma, containing extensive nested `Container`, `Column`, `Row`, and `Text` widgets to render a knowledge base information panel. The code heavily uses specific color values (`Color-Fill-Surface`, `Color-Text-Primary`, etc.) and consistent text styling with `SF Pro Text` font.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/knowledge_basement_component.dart` file saw three consecutive updates between 3:49 PM and 3:50 PM. This file contains a `KnowledgeBasement` widget, likely designed to display knowledge base information. The updates refine the component, replacing hardcoded colors with theme-aware references (`context.theme.fsColorScheme.fill.surface`) and using custom helper functions (`_buildInfoRow` and `_buildStatsItem`) for better code organization.  The structure of the component remains largely consistent across these revisions.

Finally, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/knowledge_basement.dart` file was updated multiple times between 3:56 PM and 3:58 PM. This file also seems to be a knowledge basement component, but uses a more simplified structure than the one in `knowledge_basement_component.dart`. It uses a `BoxDecoration` instead of `ShapeDecoration`, and directly uses `Text` widgets for displaying information rather than the custom helper functions used in the other component file.  The repeated updates suggest minor refinements or testing iterations.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_codegen.prompt.md` file shows an 8-step process for code generation. This suggests an automated process to translate Figma designs into Flutter code, emphasizing the importance of precise color and style matching from Figma tokens to a custom `FSColorScheme`.  The process involves analyzing Figma designs (both Dart code and potentially JSON), mapping elements to existing UI components, and finally showcasing the generated component.  The two updates of this file indicate a potential minor edit or correction to the instructions.

In summary, the log depicts a development workflow that involves transferring UI designs from Figma to a Flutter application.  This process consists of initial code import, the creation of reusable components, refinement of the components with theme support, and a structured approach to ensure consistency in color and text style between Figma and the final code.  The multiple minor updates to several files point to iterative development and testing.
