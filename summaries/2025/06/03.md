The log shows repeated modifications to a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/response/delegation_api_response.g.dart`.  This file appears to be automatically generated (indicated by "// GENERATED CODE - DO NOT MODIFY BY HAND"). The core code within the file remains consistent throughout all changes.  The only variations are in a trailing comment section added after the generated code.

The changes to the comment section began at 9:41:47 AM on June 3rd, 2025,  and continued with minor additions until 9:52:34 AM on the same day. The changes mostly involve adding names (initially just Ayush, then Abhishek Shukla, Sourik Ganguly, and Dharmendra Kumar), and finally "box8" and "swiggy".  There was a brief period of inactivity between 9:42:28 AM and 9:46:55 AM.  The final version of the comment section includes all the names and "box8" and "swiggy".  The core JSON serialization/deserialization code within the file did not change.  The modifications appear to be unrelated to the file's main function.


## 11:46:10 AM
The log details code changes related to UI code generation in a Flutter project.  Several files contain guidelines and instructions for this process.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_codegen.prompt.md` outlines a six-step process for UI code generation.  This prompt repeatedly emphasizes the importance of following steps accurately and without deviation. It involves fetching data from a Figma link, analyzing existing UI elements, and implementing a new component using existing `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules. Multiple edits to this file adjusted file paths used for referencing guideline documents.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/showcase_new_screen.instructions.md` describes how to add a newly created view component to the `fs_ui_catalog_app` module.  This involves adding exports, enum values, and a new catalog screen.  The file path within this file was adjusted multiple times to maintain proper reference to other modules.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/ui_codegen_guidelines.instructions.md` provides detailed guidelines for mapping UI components and colors from Figma designs to the project's existing components. It specifies using `core_ui` and `common_ui` components, following design consistency, adhering to clean architecture principles, and utilizing theme-driven design.  This file was also repeatedly edited throughout the log, suggesting a refinement process for the guidelines.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/ui_color_mapping_guidelines.instructions.md` offers a mapping table for translating Figma color tokens to the project's `FSColorScheme`.  This table lists Figma tokens, their corresponding paths in `FSColorScheme`, and their hex values for light and dark modes.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/ui_typography_mapping.instructions.md` maps Figma typography styles to the `FSTextTheme` in the `core_ui` module.  It specifies using existing text styles based on font weights and sizes defined within the `FSTextTheme` object.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/screen_figma.dart` contains Flutter code copied directly from Figma. This code snippet shows a `Container` with specific styling, a `Text.rich` element to display multi-styled text, and a smaller `Container` containing a "Manage" button. This file undergoes several revisions, with the commented-out sections possibly representing different stages of code evolution or experimentation.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/component/banner_component.dart` shows the implementation of a "BannerComponent" widget.  The initial implementation uses custom styles and `FSPlainButton`.  Subsequent edits involve using a `TextButton` instead of `FSPlainButton`, and then back to using `FSPlainButton` within a `Container`. Finally, the styling is adjusted for better integration with the existing theme, and a `Container` is used to wrap the `FSPlainButton`.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/freshservice_components_screen.dart` demonstrates a screen showcasing different Freshservice components, including `AttachmentPickerComponent` and finally `BannerComponent`, using a `ListView` to display them.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/banner/view/banner_component.dart` presents a more refined version of `BannerComponent` with parameters for delegate name and date, which makes it more reusable and flexible than the earlier implementations. The structure, however, remains very similar to previous iterations.

The overall pattern shows an iterative process of refining UI code generation guidelines, implementing a new component based on Figma design and incorporating feedback into multiple file revisions. The multiple edits to the `ui_codegen.prompt.md` and `showcase_new_screen.instructions.md` files, particularly the adjustment of file paths, indicate troubleshooting and refining the process of incorporating the new component.


## 2:43:36 PM
The log shows multiple updates to several files within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, primarily focusing on a `BannerComponent`.

The earliest changes (around 11:47 AM) involve the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/banner/view/banner_component.dart` file, indicating initial work on the banner component.  There is no content provided for this initial version.

Between 11:48 AM and 12:03 PM, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_codegen.prompt.md` file undergoes numerous revisions.  These revisions refine a multi-step prompt for code generation, focusing on using existing UI components from `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules and adhering to specific style guidelines. The modifications primarily clarify instructions for color mapping, emphasizing the use of exact color token names from comments in provided Dart code and referencing a color mapping guideline document.  There's a clear intention to automate UI component creation based on Figma designs.

At 11:49 AM, a `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/screen_figma.dart` file appears, containing Dart code copied from a Figma design,  showing a banner with a message about approval delegation and a "Manage" button.  The code uses hardcoded color values with comments indicating color roles (e.g., `/* Color-Overlay-Semantic-Info */`).

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/ui_color_mapping_guidelines.instructions.md` file (updated at 11:54 AM, 11:54:20 AM, 12:05:58 PM, 12:06:17 PM, 1:55:45 PM, 1:56:22 PM, 1:57:08 PM, and 2:10:35 PM, 2:11:51 PM) contains a table mapping Figma color tokens to the project's color scheme (`FSColorScheme`).  The file shows  multiple revisions, with the later versions changing the format slightly for better readability and clarifying the mapping to prevent ambiguity.


Between 11:58 AM and 12:00 PM, the `banner_component.dart` file is moved from the `banner` subdirectory to the `freshservice` subdirectory and is significantly reworked to use the project's theme and color scheme instead of hardcoded values.  Multiple minor revisions refine the code during this period.  Eventually, around 2:20 PM, this file is further simplified, accepting a `Widget` as `content` instead of individual text and date strings.


From 2:00 PM onward, the `banner_component.dart` file is significantly revised in multiple iterations, simplifying its structure and improving the integration with the project's theming system (`core_ui`).   The final version (around 2:23 PM) uses `ShapeDecoration` and `RoundedRectangleBorder` for styling.

Finally, a `banner_component_catalog_screen.dart` file is added at 2:15 PM to showcase the BannerComponent.  This file undergoes several updates, primarily involving correcting import statements and fixing a typo. The final version demonstrates two instances of the BannerComponent.  The snackbar call is changed to use `buildFSSnackBar` and a corrected call to `FSSnackBar.show`.

The overall pattern indicates an iterative process of:
1.  Creating a basic `BannerComponent`.
2.  Defining a detailed code generation prompt.
3.  Refining the color mapping guidelines.
4.  Implementing and refining the `BannerComponent` to use the project's theme and style guidelines.
5.  Creating a catalog screen for demonstrating the component.

The changes show a strong emphasis on code consistency, adherence to style guidelines, and the use of internal components to maintain a coherent design system across the application.
