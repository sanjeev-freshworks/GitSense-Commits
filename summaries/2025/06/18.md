# Activity Summary for 6/18/2025

## 12:07:16 PM
The log shows the evolution of a Dart file (`create_delegate_approval_bloc_test.dart`) containing unit tests for a "Create Delegate Approval" Bloc.  The initial commit at 11:35:07 AM on June 18, 2025, shows a placeholder for a mockito file. The subsequent commits between 11:55:03 AM and 11:58:21 AM on the same day detail the development of comprehensive unit tests using `bloc_test`, `mockito`, and other related packages.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/test/ui/delegate_approval/bloc/create_delegate_approval_bloc_test.dart` file undergoes several revisions.  The key changes revolve around expanding the test suite to cover various scenarios of the bloc's functionality:

* **View Creation:** Tests the loading of the UI model when the view is created.
* **Form Field Changes:**  Tests the updating of individual form fields.
* **Form Validation:** Tests handling of both successful and failed validation, including specific error messages.  The validation checks for required fields and ensures the "Until" date is after the "From" date.
* **Delegate Approval Creation:** Covers both successful and failed creation scenarios.

The tests extensively use mocks for various dependencies like `CreateDelegateApprovalUseCase`, `EditDelegateApprovalUseCase`, `CreateDelegateApprovalUiMapper`, `UserDateTimeConfigurationProvider`, and `DelegateApprovalFormValidator`.  The  `UserDateTimeConfiguration` is consistently used in test setups, with a defined date, time, and timezone format.

Minor changes between the later commits (11:57:31 AM and 11:58:21 AM) seem to be focused on refining the code and potentially adjusting the `UserDateTimeConfiguration`. The `timeZone` property is replaced with `tzLocation` in the `UserDateTimeConfiguration` object, suggesting a slight alteration in how timezones are handled.  The core functionality and structure of the tests remain consistent across these minor revisions.  The tests are thoroughly structured and well-documented.


## 1:07:26 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Dart file (`create_delegate_approval_bloc.dart`) and its corresponding test file (`create_delegate_approval_bloc_test.dart`).  The `create_delegate_approval_bloc.dart` file is a BLoC (Business Logic Component) for managing the creation and editing of delegate approvals.  It handles various events such as `ViewCreated`, `OnFormFieldChanged`, `DelegateClicked`, and `NavigationAndUserMessageHandled`.  The bloc interacts with use cases (`CreateDelegateApprovalUseCase`, `EditDelegateApprovalUseCase`) to perform actions related to creating and editing delegate approvals. It also utilizes a UI mapper (`CreateDelegateApprovalUiMapper`) and a form validator (`DelegateApprovalFormValidator`).  A key change between revisions of `create_delegate_approval_bloc.dart` (between 12:26:06 PM and 12:27:52 PM) simplifies the `_validateAndBuildDelegationParam` method, removing unnecessary null checks and improving type safety.


The `create_delegate_approval_bloc_test.dart` file contains unit tests for the BLoC using the `bloc_test` package. These tests cover various scenarios, including form field updates, successful use case execution, and handling of form validation errors.  Multiple revisions of this file show iterative improvements and refinements to the test suite, primarily between 12:29:21 PM and 12:49:27 PM, where the tests for `OnFormFieldChanged` and `DelegateClicked` events are significantly expanded and made more robust.  The final revision at 12:49:27 PM shows complete and refined test cases.  The tests extensively use mock objects for dependencies, like use cases and validators, to isolate the BLoC's logic during testing.  A recurring theme in these tests is the use of `CreateDelegateApprovalConstants` for managing field names and ids, ensuring consistency throughout the code.  The final revisions improve the test cases for the `DelegateClicked` event to handle both successful and failed scenarios more effectively. The timestamp of the last significant change in `create_delegate_approval_bloc_test.dart` is 12:49:27 PM.
