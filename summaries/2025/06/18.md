# Activity Summary for 6/18/2025

## 12:07:16 PM
The log shows the evolution of a Dart file (`create_delegate_approval_bloc_test.dart`) containing unit tests for a "Create Delegate Approval" Bloc.  The initial commit at 11:35:07 AM on June 18, 2025, shows a placeholder for a mockito file. The subsequent commits between 11:55:03 AM and 11:58:21 AM on the same day detail the development of comprehensive unit tests using `bloc_test`, `mockito`, and other related packages.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/test/ui/delegate_approval/bloc/create_delegate_approval_bloc_test.dart` file undergoes several revisions.  The key changes revolve around expanding the test suite to cover various scenarios of the bloc's functionality:

* **View Creation:** Tests the loading of the UI model when the view is created.
* **Form Field Changes:**  Tests the updating of individual form fields.
* **Form Validation:** Tests handling of both successful and failed validation, including specific error messages.  The validation checks for required fields and ensures the "Until" date is after the "From" date.
* **Delegate Approval Creation:** Covers both successful and failed creation scenarios.

The tests extensively use mocks for various dependencies like `CreateDelegateApprovalUseCase`, `EditDelegateApprovalUseCase`, `CreateDelegateApprovalUiMapper`, `UserDateTimeConfigurationProvider`, and `DelegateApprovalFormValidator`.  The  `UserDateTimeConfiguration` is consistently used in test setups, with a defined date, time, and timezone format.

Minor changes between the later commits (11:57:31 AM and 11:58:21 AM) seem to be focused on refining the code and potentially adjusting the `UserDateTimeConfiguration`. The `timeZone` property is replaced with `tzLocation` in the `UserDateTimeConfiguration` object, suggesting a slight alteration in how timezones are handled.  The core functionality and structure of the tests remain consistent across these minor revisions.  The tests are thoroughly structured and well-documented.


## 1:07:26 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Dart file (`create_delegate_approval_bloc.dart`) and its corresponding test file (`create_delegate_approval_bloc_test.dart`).  The `create_delegate_approval_bloc.dart` file is a BLoC (Business Logic Component) for managing the creation and editing of delegate approvals.  It handles various events such as `ViewCreated`, `OnFormFieldChanged`, `DelegateClicked`, and `NavigationAndUserMessageHandled`.  The bloc interacts with use cases (`CreateDelegateApprovalUseCase`, `EditDelegateApprovalUseCase`) to perform actions related to creating and editing delegate approvals. It also utilizes a UI mapper (`CreateDelegateApprovalUiMapper`) and a form validator (`DelegateApprovalFormValidator`).  A key change between revisions of `create_delegate_approval_bloc.dart` (between 12:26:06 PM and 12:27:52 PM) simplifies the `_validateAndBuildDelegationParam` method, removing unnecessary null checks and improving type safety.


The `create_delegate_approval_bloc_test.dart` file contains unit tests for the BLoC using the `bloc_test` package. These tests cover various scenarios, including form field updates, successful use case execution, and handling of form validation errors.  Multiple revisions of this file show iterative improvements and refinements to the test suite, primarily between 12:29:21 PM and 12:49:27 PM, where the tests for `OnFormFieldChanged` and `DelegateClicked` events are significantly expanded and made more robust.  The final revision at 12:49:27 PM shows complete and refined test cases.  The tests extensively use mock objects for dependencies, like use cases and validators, to isolate the BLoC's logic during testing.  A recurring theme in these tests is the use of `CreateDelegateApprovalConstants` for managing field names and ids, ensuring consistency throughout the code.  The final revisions improve the test cases for the `DelegateClicked` event to handle both successful and failed scenarios more effectively. The timestamp of the last significant change in `create_delegate_approval_bloc_test.dart` is 12:49:27 PM.


## 4:07:16 PM
The log shows several iterations of unit tests for a `SearchUsersUseCase`.  The primary focus is testing the use case's behavior for different user types (requester and agent) and handling various success and failure scenarios.

Initially (6/18/2025, 3:28:46 PM and 3:29:09 PM), the tests used mocked interactions extensively, verifying method calls on mocked dependencies like `UserInteractor`, `SearchAllUsersUseCase`, and `SearchRequestersUseCase`.  These early tests covered searching users as requesters and agents, including handling null values in the search results.  Error handling was also included, testing exception propagation from underlying use cases.

Subsequent updates (starting around 6/18/2025, 3:48:01 PM) transitioned the tests to utilize dependency injection (`ApprovalsDIModuleTest.register()`, `CommonBusinessLibModule.register()`).  The mocking strategy shifted from mocking all dependencies to mocking only `UserInteractor`, relying on dependency injection for `SearchAllUsersUseCase` and `SearchRequestersUseCase`.  This was likely done to simplify the setup and focus on testing the core logic of `SearchUsersUseCase`.

The tests consistently use fixture data from `support_search_user_fixture.dart` and `user_fixture.dart` to simulate user and search results.  There's a recurring pattern of verifying the `getCurrentUser()` method call on `UserInteractor` and testing the appropriate underlying use case (`SearchAllUsersUseCase` for requesters, `SearchRequestersUseCase` for agents) is called depending on the user type.

Between 3:48:01 PM and 4:00:36 PM, the tests evolved significantly. Initially, dummy data was used using `provideDummy`, later replaced by a more robust approach using `when` to mock the return values of the dependent use cases, allowing for precise control over the test outcomes and verifying specific interactions with the mocked dependencies. The final version (4:02:16 PM) improved readability by using region comments to clearly organize the test cases for requester and agent user types and refined the assertion to verify that the incorrect use case was not called.  The final version of the test explicitly verifies that only the expected use case is called for each user type and checks for the expected results.  This change indicates a better focus on isolating the behavior of the `SearchUsersUseCase` itself.


## 5:07:19 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/test/ui/delegate_approval/bloc/create_delegate_approval_bloc_test.dart` between 4:39:23 PM and 4:43:40 PM on June 18th, 2025.  These revisions primarily involve modifications to unit tests for a `CreateDelegateApprovalBloc`.

The initial revision (4:39:23 PM) contained several `blocTest` configurations testing various bloc events and states, including `ViewCreated`, `OnFormFieldChanged`, and `DelegateClicked`.  These tests extensively utilize mock objects (`MockCreateDelegateApprovalUseCase`, `MockUiMapper`, etc.) to simulate interactions with the use case and UI mapper.

Subsequent revisions (4:40:11 PM, 4:41:12 PM, 4:42:20 PM, and 4:43:40 PM) made incremental changes, primarily focused on refining the `blocTest` setups and assertions.  The most significant change occurred in the final revision (4:43:40 PM) where an import statement was added: `import '../../../testfixture/ui/delegate_approvals/approval_delegation_fixture.dart';`. This suggests the introduction of test fixtures for approval delegation, potentially improving the test data management.  The `flutter_bloc` package was also added as a dependency in one of the intermediate revisions.  The overall structure and testing logic within the file remained consistent across all revisions, suggesting iterative debugging and improvements to the unit test suite rather than a complete overhaul.  The tests cover various scenarios, including successful use case execution and form validation.
The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/test/domain/usecase/search_users_use_case_test.dart` shows a single revision at 4:18:34 PM on June 18th, 2025. This file contains unit tests for a `SearchUsersUseCase`, testing for successful searches based on user type (requester or agent).  The tests utilize mocking to isolate and verify the behavior of the use case and its dependencies.


## 6:07:16 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/test/ui/delegate_approval/mapper/create_edit_delegate_approval_ui_mapper_test.dart`.  This file contains unit tests for a UI mapper (`CreateDelegateApprovalUiMapper`).

The changes span a short period, between 5:08:19 PM and 5:20:22 PM on June 18, 2025.  The primary focus of the modifications appears to be refining the unit tests, specifically improving the handling of localization and input scenarios.  Several revisions involved adjusting import statements, likely to resolve build issues or update dependencies.

The core functionality of the unit tests remains consistent throughout the revisions: testing the mapper's ability to handle both create and edit modes for delegate approvals, verifying the correct mapping of UI models based on the input parameters (especially focusing on handling null or empty values for the delegatee information).  The final revision at 5:20:22 PM uses `ApprovalLibLocalizationsEn` for more precise localization testing, making the test more robust and specific.
