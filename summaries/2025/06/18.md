# Activity Summary for 6/18/2025

## 12:07:16 PM
The log shows the evolution of a Dart file (`create_delegate_approval_bloc_test.dart`) containing unit tests for a "Create Delegate Approval" Bloc.  The initial commit at 11:35:07 AM on June 18, 2025, shows a placeholder for a mockito file. The subsequent commits between 11:55:03 AM and 11:58:21 AM on the same day detail the development of comprehensive unit tests using `bloc_test`, `mockito`, and other related packages.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/test/ui/delegate_approval/bloc/create_delegate_approval_bloc_test.dart` file undergoes several revisions.  The key changes revolve around expanding the test suite to cover various scenarios of the bloc's functionality:

* **View Creation:** Tests the loading of the UI model when the view is created.
* **Form Field Changes:**  Tests the updating of individual form fields.
* **Form Validation:** Tests handling of both successful and failed validation, including specific error messages.  The validation checks for required fields and ensures the "Until" date is after the "From" date.
* **Delegate Approval Creation:** Covers both successful and failed creation scenarios.

The tests extensively use mocks for various dependencies like `CreateDelegateApprovalUseCase`, `EditDelegateApprovalUseCase`, `CreateDelegateApprovalUiMapper`, `UserDateTimeConfigurationProvider`, and `DelegateApprovalFormValidator`.  The  `UserDateTimeConfiguration` is consistently used in test setups, with a defined date, time, and timezone format.

Minor changes between the later commits (11:57:31 AM and 11:58:21 AM) seem to be focused on refining the code and potentially adjusting the `UserDateTimeConfiguration`. The `timeZone` property is replaced with `tzLocation` in the `UserDateTimeConfiguration` object, suggesting a slight alteration in how timezones are handled.  The core functionality and structure of the tests remain consistent across these minor revisions.  The tests are thoroughly structured and well-documented.
