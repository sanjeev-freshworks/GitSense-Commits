# Activity Summary for 6/8/2025

## 9:48:54 AM
The log shows code changes across several files within the `mobile_flutter_freshservice` project on June 8th, 2025.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/banner_component.dart` file was updated at 9:39:00 AM and then again at 9:45:15 AM. The second update contains a complete implementation of a `BannerComponent` widget. This widget is a customizable banner displaying a title, optional message, icon, and action/close buttons, leveraging the `core_ui` library for styling and components.  The 9:47:57 AM update to this file is empty, suggesting a potential accidental commit or a placeholder.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/screen_figma.dart` file was updated twice at 9:40:20 AM and 9:40:25 AM.  Both updates show nearly identical, extensive Flutter code describing a UI screen layout likely generated from Figma. This code heavily uses `Container`, `Stack`, `Positioned`, `Row`, `Column`, and `Text` widgets to define the screen's structure and content, including text fields, buttons, and spacing.  The minor difference between the two commits is not immediately apparent from the provided code snippets.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_codegen.prompt.md` file was updated at 9:42:10 AM.  This file outlines a multi-step process for UI code generation. It involves gathering input (module, component name, notes), analyzing Figma design files (`.dart` and potentially `.json`), applying UI code generation guidelines, implementing the component using existing UI components (from `core_ui` and `common_ui`), showcasing the component, and finally fixing any errors.  The process emphasizes adherence to UI guidelines and avoiding the use of standard Flutter widgets.

The timestamps show a sequence of activities: first, a banner component is briefly touched; then, a Figma screen's Dart code is recorded; next, the UI code generation process is defined; and lastly, a full implementation of the banner component is committed.  This suggests a workflow involving Figma design, code generation, and then component integration into the main application.  The repeated use of specific color constants (e.g., `Color(0xFF27313B)`) and font family (`SF Pro Text`) indicates a consistent design system is being followed.
