# Activity Summary for 6/8/2025

## 9:48:54 AM
The log shows code changes across several files within the `mobile_flutter_freshservice` project on June 8th, 2025.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/banner_component.dart` file was updated at 9:39:00 AM and then again at 9:45:15 AM. The second update contains a complete implementation of a `BannerComponent` widget. This widget is a customizable banner displaying a title, optional message, icon, and action/close buttons, leveraging the `core_ui` library for styling and components.  The 9:47:57 AM update to this file is empty, suggesting a potential accidental commit or a placeholder.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/screen_figma.dart` file was updated twice at 9:40:20 AM and 9:40:25 AM.  Both updates show nearly identical, extensive Flutter code describing a UI screen layout likely generated from Figma. This code heavily uses `Container`, `Stack`, `Positioned`, `Row`, `Column`, and `Text` widgets to define the screen's structure and content, including text fields, buttons, and spacing.  The minor difference between the two commits is not immediately apparent from the provided code snippets.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_codegen.prompt.md` file was updated at 9:42:10 AM.  This file outlines a multi-step process for UI code generation. It involves gathering input (module, component name, notes), analyzing Figma design files (`.dart` and potentially `.json`), applying UI code generation guidelines, implementing the component using existing UI components (from `core_ui` and `common_ui`), showcasing the component, and finally fixing any errors.  The process emphasizes adherence to UI guidelines and avoiding the use of standard Flutter widgets.

The timestamps show a sequence of activities: first, a banner component is briefly touched; then, a Figma screen's Dart code is recorded; next, the UI code generation process is defined; and lastly, a full implementation of the banner component is committed.  This suggests a workflow involving Figma design, code generation, and then component integration into the main application.  The repeated use of specific color constants (e.g., `Color(0xFF27313B)`) and font family (`SF Pro Text`) indicates a consistent design system is being followed.


## 10:49:02 AM
The log shows several code changes across multiple Dart files within a Flutter project, primarily focused on creating and refining UI components.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/screen_figma.dart` file underwent multiple revisions between 9:49 AM and 10:33 AM.  These revisions seem to be iterative refinements of a UI element representing approval delegation, initially a `Message` widget and later evolving into a more comprehensive `Artboard` structure.  The code consistently utilizes `Column`, `Row`, `Container`, `Text.rich`, `TextSpan`, and `ShapeDecoration` widgets for layout and styling.  Color values are consistently defined using `const Color()` with hex codes and descriptive comments like `/* Color-Text-Secondary */`.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/banner_component.dart` file was modified extensively between 9:51 AM and 10:10 AM.  The `BannerComponent` widget was developed, initially taking four string parameters for text content, and later adding optional `manageButtonText` and `onManagePressed` callback parameters to support an action button.  Similar to `screen_figma.dart`, this file leverages `Column`, `Container`, `ShapeDecoration`, `Text.rich`, and `TextSpan` extensively. The notable change is the migration from hardcoded color values to using a theme-based approach (`context.theme.fsColorScheme`).  Between 10:10 AM and 10:22 AM the file was completely rewritten to reflect a more efficient approach using TextSpan.  Finally, it was further refined multiple times before being replaced.


Another significant change occurred with the creation of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/banner/banner_component.dart` between 10:16 AM and 10:22 AM. This file created a more streamlined `BannerComponent` widget using `TextSpan` to handle rich text and an optional button.


The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/banner_component_catalog_screen.dart` (modified at 10:20 AM) showcases the `BannerComponent` in a catalog screen, demonstrating its usage.  The use of `_CatalogItem` suggests a reusable structure for catalog entries.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/edit_approval_screen_content.dart` file was modified between 10:28 AM and 10:32 AM. This involved creating a component to handle delegate selection for approval delegation, using  `FSTextField`, `FSAlertDialog`, and `FSAvatarView` from a custom UI library.


Finally, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/approval_detail_screen_content.dart` file  underwent several modifications  around 10:37 AM and 10:45 AM,  resulting in a simplified structure showing only basic approval details and actions.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/ui/ui_codegen.prompt.md` file shows a set of detailed steps for code generation based on Figma designs. These steps were refined over time, with early versions including more instructions on parsing Dart code, and later versions focusing more on using Figma links to fetch the necessary design data.  The overall goal of the prompt is to automatically generate and verify Flutter code from Figma designs, ensuring consistency in color usage and adherence to UI guidelines.  The numerous revisions reflect the iterative refinement of this automated code generation process.
