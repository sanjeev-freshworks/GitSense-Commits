# Activity Summary for 6/17/2025

## 12:14:53 AM
The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/ui/delegate_approval/presentation/bloc/create_delegate_approval_bloc.dart` (last updated 6/16/2025, 11:21:32 PM) contains a Flutter Bloc for creating and editing delegate approvals.  The Bloc handles user interactions, form validation, and data persistence using various use cases and helper classes.  Key features include:

* **Form Handling:** The Bloc manages a form with fields for delegatee, start date, end date, and notes. It uses `FormFieldUIModel` for form field management and `DelegateApprovalFormValidator` for validation. Date validation ensures the 'Until' date is after the 'From' date.

* **Use Cases:**  It leverages `CreateDelegateApprovalUseCase` and `EditDelegateApprovalUseCase` for creating and editing delegate approvals respectively. The `_validateAndBuildDelegationParam` function prepares parameters for these use cases.  A placeholder `delegateToValue` (123123123) is used and needs replacement with actual user ID.

* **State Management:** The Bloc uses `CreateEditDelegateApprovalState` to manage different states (loading, content, error).  It uses a `CreateEditDelegateApprovalStateContent` to hold UI model data, including form fields. Navigation states are handled using `CreateEditDelegateApprovalNavigationState`.

* **Event Handling:**  It responds to events like `CreateEditDelegateApprovalEventViewCreated`, `CreateEditDelegateApprovalEventOnFormFieldChanged`, `CreateEditDelegateApprovalDelegateClicked`, and `CreateEditDelegateApprovalEventNavigationAndUserMessageHandled`, each triggering specific actions within the bloc.

* **Error Handling:** The bloc handles exceptions from use cases and displays appropriate error messages to the user. Error states are clearly managed within the bloc states.

* **UI Mapping:**  A `CreateDelegateApprovalUiMapper` is used to transform data into a UI-friendly model.

The code heavily relies on custom classes and models within the `approval_lib` and related libraries.  A significant portion of the code deals with form field updates, validation, and state transitions based on user interactions and use case results.  The `_validateAndBuildDelegationParam` function currently uses a hardcoded `delegateToValue` and needs to be updated to correctly retrieve the delegatee's ID from the UI model.
