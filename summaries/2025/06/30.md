# Activity Summary for 6/30/2025

## 8:04:44 PM
The log shows a series of code changes related to the Freshservice mobile Flutter application.  The primary change is the creation and modification of a comprehensive set of instructions for an AI assistant (`copilot-instructions.md`), detailing the project's architecture, coding standards, and best practices. This document was updated twice within a short timeframe (6:06:29 PM and 6:06:41 PM on June 30th, 2025), primarily to refine the “Goals for AI Assistant” section, adding a focus on code quality, reusability, and scalability in the second update.

The project uses a modular monorepo structure managed by Melos, employing Clean Architecture, BLoC pattern for state management, and various other libraries like `get_it`, `flutter_bloc`, and `go_router`.  The codebase is extensively documented, specifying clear guidelines for naming conventions, data models, testing, and code generation using tools like `freezed` and `json_serializable`.  A significant part of the instructions focuses on the data layer code generation, outlining a detailed prompt (`data_layer_codegen.prompt.md`) to automate this process based on user input (CURL commands, JSON responses, and specifications for enums and date/time fields). A sample prompt file (`sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md`) provides an example of how to use the data layer code generation prompt. Finally, a `.vscode/settings.json` file configures VS Code settings for the project, including task management using a Copilot Buddy extension and specifying locations for chat prompts.
