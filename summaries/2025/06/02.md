# Activity Summary for 6/2/2025

## 1:00:42 PM
The log shows two code changes.  The first, at 12:59:24 PM on June 2nd, 2025, involves a modification to an approval card component (`approval_card.dart`) within the `fs_ui_catalog_app`  module of a Flutter project. The specific nature of the changes to the `approval_card.dart` file is not provided.

The second change, at 1:00:28 PM on June 2nd, 2025, is a markdown file (`ui_codegen.prompt.md`) outlining a five-step process for UI code generation.  This process involves:  analyzing a Figma design, mapping UI components and colors to existing modules (`core_ui` and `common_ui`), implementing the component in `fs_ui_catalog_app` using only existing components, showcasing the new component, and finally, fixing any errors and adhering to UI guidelines.  The instructions emphasize strict adherence to the steps and avoidance of any deviation.  The process leverages several external files, including Figma links and guideline documents.  The overall pattern suggests an automated or semi-automated UI development workflow based on Figma designs and pre-defined component libraries.

The log shows several code changes across multiple Dart files within a Flutter project, seemingly related to a Freshservice mobile application.  The primary focus appears to be on creating and refining UI components.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/message_notification_component.dart` underwent several revisions between 1:02 PM and 1:03 PM on June 2nd, 2025. These revisions primarily involved changing the visual styling of the `FSCard` component, transitioning from a custom `FSCard` to a standard `Card` widget and adjusting its color, border, and elevation properties to match a design specification.  The core functionality remained consistent, displaying sample delegation messages.

Later, a new component, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/delegation_banner.dart`, was created and iteratively improved between 1:24 PM and 1:29 PM on June 2nd, 2025. This component, designed to display delegation information, leveraged the `core_ui` library, undergoing adjustments to its styling and theme integration using `fsColorScheme`.  The `TextStyle` was refined for better consistency with the design. The final version used `FSText` and `FSPlainButton` from the `core_ui` library.


The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/knowledge_base_article_card.dart` was also modified between 1:37 PM and 1:38 PM on June 2nd, 2025.  This involved structural changes, moving the padding from the `FSCard` to a `Padding` widget within the `FSCard`'s child.  The functionality of displaying knowledge base article information remained the same.


Finally, a `KnowledgeBaseArticleBottomSheet` component was added at 1:44 PM on June 2nd, 2025, and subsequently refined until 1:52 PM.  This bottom sheet displays knowledge base article details, using a similar structure and styling as the `KnowledgeBaseArticleCard` but adapted for a bottom sheet presentation. The `fsShowModalBottomSheet` function was used for displaying the bottomsheet.  The unnecessary `backgroundColor` property was removed from the `fsShowModalBottomSheet` function.

The `.github/prompts/data/temp_prompts/ui_codegen.prompt.md` file contains instructions for UI code generation, referencing Figma designs and specifying constraints for using only existing UI components from `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules. The prompt was edited a few times, specifically removing some instructions and adding a note to implement a component as a bottom sheet. This suggests an iterative development process driven by a code generation tool guided by Figma designs and style guides.  The numerous revisions to `screen_figma.dart` reflect refinement of the design during the code generation process.
