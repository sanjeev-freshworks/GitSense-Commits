# Activity Summary for 6/2/2025

## 1:00:42 PM
The log shows two code changes.  The first, at 12:59:24 PM on June 2nd, 2025, involves a modification to an approval card component (`approval_card.dart`) within the `fs_ui_catalog_app`  module of a Flutter project. The specific nature of the changes to the `approval_card.dart` file is not provided.

The second change, at 1:00:28 PM on June 2nd, 2025, is a markdown file (`ui_codegen.prompt.md`) outlining a five-step process for UI code generation.  This process involves:  analyzing a Figma design, mapping UI components and colors to existing modules (`core_ui` and `common_ui`), implementing the component in `fs_ui_catalog_app` using only existing components, showcasing the new component, and finally, fixing any errors and adhering to UI guidelines.  The instructions emphasize strict adherence to the steps and avoidance of any deviation.  The process leverages several external files, including Figma links and guideline documents.  The overall pattern suggests an automated or semi-automated UI development workflow based on Figma designs and pre-defined component libraries.
