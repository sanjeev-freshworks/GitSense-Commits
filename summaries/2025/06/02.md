# Activity Summary for 6/2/2025

## 1:00:42 PM
The log shows two code changes.  The first, at 12:59:24 PM on June 2nd, 2025, involves a modification to an approval card component (`approval_card.dart`) within the `fs_ui_catalog_app`  module of a Flutter project. The specific nature of the changes to the `approval_card.dart` file is not provided.

The second change, at 1:00:28 PM on June 2nd, 2025, is a markdown file (`ui_codegen.prompt.md`) outlining a five-step process for UI code generation.  This process involves:  analyzing a Figma design, mapping UI components and colors to existing modules (`core_ui` and `common_ui`), implementing the component in `fs_ui_catalog_app` using only existing components, showcasing the new component, and finally, fixing any errors and adhering to UI guidelines.  The instructions emphasize strict adherence to the steps and avoidance of any deviation.  The process leverages several external files, including Figma links and guideline documents.  The overall pattern suggests an automated or semi-automated UI development workflow based on Figma designs and pre-defined component libraries.


## 2:00:53 PM
The log shows several code changes across multiple Dart files within a Flutter project, seemingly related to a Freshservice mobile application.  The primary focus appears to be on creating and refining UI components.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/message_notification_component.dart` underwent several revisions between 1:02 PM and 1:03 PM on June 2nd, 2025. These revisions primarily involved changing the visual styling of the `FSCard` component, transitioning from a custom `FSCard` to a standard `Card` widget and adjusting its color, border, and elevation properties to match a design specification.  The core functionality remained consistent, displaying sample delegation messages.

Later, a new component, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/delegation_banner.dart`, was created and iteratively improved between 1:24 PM and 1:29 PM on June 2nd, 2025. This component, designed to display delegation information, leveraged the `core_ui` library, undergoing adjustments to its styling and theme integration using `fsColorScheme`.  The `TextStyle` was refined for better consistency with the design. The final version used `FSText` and `FSPlainButton` from the `core_ui` library.


The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/knowledge_base_article_card.dart` was also modified between 1:37 PM and 1:38 PM on June 2nd, 2025.  This involved structural changes, moving the padding from the `FSCard` to a `Padding` widget within the `FSCard`'s child.  The functionality of displaying knowledge base article information remained the same.


Finally, a `KnowledgeBaseArticleBottomSheet` component was added at 1:44 PM on June 2nd, 2025, and subsequently refined until 1:52 PM.  This bottom sheet displays knowledge base article details, using a similar structure and styling as the `KnowledgeBaseArticleCard` but adapted for a bottom sheet presentation. The `fsShowModalBottomSheet` function was used for displaying the bottomsheet.  The unnecessary `backgroundColor` property was removed from the `fsShowModalBottomSheet` function.

The `.github/prompts/data/temp_prompts/ui_codegen.prompt.md` file contains instructions for UI code generation, referencing Figma designs and specifying constraints for using only existing UI components from `core_ui` and `common_ui` modules. The prompt was edited a few times, specifically removing some instructions and adding a note to implement a component as a bottom sheet. This suggests an iterative development process driven by a code generation tool guided by Figma designs and style guides.  The numerous revisions to `screen_figma.dart` reflect refinement of the design during the code generation process.


## 4:00:51 PM
The log shows a series of edits to a UI code generation prompt file (`ui_codegen.prompt.md`) and a  `banner_component.dart` file.  The `ui_codegen.prompt.md` file underwent numerous revisions between 3:24 PM and 3:35 PM on June 2nd, 2025.  These revisions primarily involved refining the instructions for code generation, focusing on clarifying the input requirements and output expectations. Initially, the prompt only included a Figma screen's Dart code for analysis, but later versions added instructions to include Figma JSON and a Figma link, improving the completeness of the input data.  The prompt's structure evolved from a simple step-by-step guide to a more sophisticated system that requested specific inputs (module, component name, Figma link, and special notes). The final version of the prompt explicitly asks for the module and component name,  allowing for more flexible code generation.  The prompt consistently emphasizes adhering to UI guidelines and using existing UI components (`core_ui`, `common_ui`) to avoid creating new ones.  The `banner_component.dart` file, on the other hand, shows no code changes across multiple timestamps suggesting that either only one version was committed, or these timestamps do not represent code changes but possibly metadata updates of the file.  The `banner_component.dart` file appears to be a well-structured Flutter widget using the `core_ui` library.  The  `visual-general-instructions.md` and other `.md` files detailing repository guidelines, request model guidelines, and API constants guidelines illustrate a structured approach to the project's organization and data handling.  These documents outline clear naming conventions, file locations, and code structures aimed at maintaining consistency across the project.


## 6:00:52 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a markdown file (`ui_codegen_guidelines.instructions.md`) detailing UI component mapping guidelines for a Flutter application, along with several markdown files outlining guidelines for API to data model mapping and remote data source creation.  These changes all occurred on June 2nd, 2025, between approximately 5:18 PM and 5:34 PM.

The `ui_codegen_guidelines.instructions.md` file remained largely unchanged across its revisions; only the timestamp changed, suggesting the file wasn't modified substantively during this period.  The file provides a comprehensive guide on how to map UI components from Figma designs to custom Freshservice Flutter components (`core_ui` and `common_ui` modules), emphasizing consistency, clean architecture, theme-driven design, and accessibility. It includes detailed examples for buttons, input fields, form controls (checkboxes, radio buttons, toggles), search fields, content display elements (tags, chips, avatars), and dialogs/modals.

The other markdown files detail best practices for:

* **API to Data Model Mapping:**  This document describes the structure and conventions for mapping API responses to data models in Dart, emphasizing handling of nullability and default values.  It showcases a directory structure,  extension methods (`toDataModel()`), and logic for dealing with missing or invalid fields.  The use of mermaid diagrams to illustrate directory structures and mapping logic is a recurring element.

* **Remote Data Source Creation:** This outlines the structure and conventions for creating remote data sources (`{module}_remote_data_source.dart`), including class naming (`{ModuleName}RemoteDataSource`), method naming (`{httpMethod}{apiPath}`), and usage of a base class (`FSBaseRemoteDataSource`).  It stresses the use of constants for API paths and the consistent use of helper methods for query parameter and body preparation. Mermaid diagrams are used here as well for visual clarity.

The final file is a prompt file (`data_layer_codegen.prompt.md`) guiding code generation for a Flutter data layer,  providing a structured process for gathering user input (module details, request details, response details), validating the input, and generating several code components (API constants, request/response models, mappers, remote data source, and repository).  This prompt uses a structured, step-by-step approach and references several supporting guideline documents.  An example of a user input for a 'ticket' module is provided in the prompt.  A second prompt file (`delegate_approval_get_request.prompt.md`) specifies a concrete code generation task using this data layer prompt.


In summary, the changes reflect a focused effort on documenting and standardizing the development of the data layer and UI layer in a Flutter application using Freshservice components, focusing on code consistency and maintainability.  The use of mermaid diagrams for visualization consistently appears across the provided documentation.
