# Activity Summary for 6/23/2025

## 9:43:10 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/ui/delegate_approval/presentation/bloc/create_delegate_approval_bloc.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/fields/form_date_time_field_ui_model.dart` between 8:45 AM and 9:13 AM on June 23, 2025.

The `create_delegate_approval_bloc.dart` file underwent several revisions focusing on the `_emitStateWithUpdatedFormField` function.  Initial versions handled updating the "Until" date field's constraint based on changes to the "From" date field.  Later versions added a check to clear the "Until" date if the "From" date is set to an earlier date than the previously selected "From" date. The final change introduced an error message ("Hello error") to the "Until" field under a specific condition.  These changes improve the date validation logic and user experience.

The `form_date_time_field_ui_model.dart` file was modified multiple times between 8:58 AM and 8:59 AM.  These changes consistently involved adding the `initialDate` parameter to the `FormDateTimeFieldUIModel` class and updating the `copyWith`, `==`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods to reflect this addition.  The addition of `initialDate` likely enhances the usability and functionality of the date-time field model by providing a default or starting date for the field.


## 1:55:27 PM
The log shows two nearly identical revisions of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/datetime/fs_form_date_time_field.dart`.  Both revisions are from June 23rd, 2025, with only a one-minute difference in timestamps (1:13:46 PM and 1:14:02 PM).

The key difference between the two versions is the addition of a `didUpdateWidget` method in the second revision. This method checks if the `model` has changed and calls `_initializeDateTimeInLocation` if it has.  This improves the widget's responsiveness to changes in the `FormDateTimeFieldUIModel`.  The rest of the code, which constitutes a custom Flutter `FSFormDateTimeField` widget for handling date and time input, remains unchanged.  The widget handles date and time selection, timezone conversions using the `timezone` package, and error display.  It uses several custom packages from the Freshservice project (e.g., `common_business`, `common_ui`, `core_ui`, `user_lib`).  The code efficiently handles both date-only and date-time selections and updates the model accordingly.
