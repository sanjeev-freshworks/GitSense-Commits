This document details a process for generating Flutter data layer code from user-provided input.  The process involves four main steps: gathering user input, parsing that input, presenting it for confirmation, and finally, generating the code.

The user input includes module details (module name), request details (cURL command, query parameters, request body), and response details (JSON response, mandatory and default fields, enums, and date/time fields).  The parser extracts HTTP method, API path, and other relevant information from the cURL command.  A confirmation checklist ensures the accuracy of the extracted data, allowing for edits before proceeding.

Code generation is then performed step-by-step, creating API constants, request and response models (including enums if necessary), mappers, remote data source, and a repository (interface and implementation).  The generated code adheres to a specific package structure outlined in the document, aiming for separation of concerns between data sources, models, and repositories.  The example uses a Freshservice API call to retrieve tickets as a demonstration.  The timestamp indicates that this prompt was last updated on June 16th, 2025, at 10:18:03 AM.
