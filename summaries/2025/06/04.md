# Activity Summary for 6/4/2025

## 11:03:22 AM
The log shows code changes across several files within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project on June 4, 2025.  The main focus appears to be on establishing a consistent typography mapping and text style conversion process for a Flutter application.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/model/freshservice_components_elements.dart` (10:25:17 AM):** This file defines an enum `FreshserviceComponentsElements` with a single member, "Attachment Picker", including a `displayName` field. This suggests the addition of an attachment picker component to the UI catalog application.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/knowledge_basement/knowledge_basement.dart` (10:43:58 AM - 10:46:36 AM):**  This file contains the definition of a `KnowledgeBasement` widget. Multiple edits refine its styling and structure, using `FSCard`, `FSColorScheme`, and `FSTextTheme` from a `core_ui` package.  These edits primarily focus on improving the visual presentation of the Knowledge Basement component, adjusting padding, colors, and text styles.  Later edits remove unnecessary `padding` from the `FSCard`.


**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/knowledge_basement_catalog_screen.dart` (10:46:09 AM):** This file showcases the `KnowledgeBasement` widget with various configurations (`default`, `custom`, and `minimal`), demonstrating its flexibility in a catalog screen.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/freshservice/view/components/knowledge_basement.dart` (10:51:29 AM - 10:52:23 AM):** This file defines a `KnowledgeBasement` widget. The changes made here simplify the widget by removing optional parameters and changing the type of `folderCount` and `articleCount` from `int` to `String`.  The styling is also simplified, using only `FSTextTheme` for text styles.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/knowledge_base/knowledge_base_info_card.dart` (10:55:44 AM - 10:55:57 AM):** This file defines a `KnowledgeBaseInfoCard` widget which displays knowledge base article information in a card format, similar to `KnowledgeBasement`, using `FSCard`, `FSColorScheme`, and `FSTextTheme`.  One edit removes all content, possibly signifying a refactor or deletion.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/context/ui/ui_typography_mapping.instructions.md` (10:36:32 AM - 11:03:01 AM):** This Markdown file documents the mapping between font weights and sizes used in the Figma design tool and the corresponding `FSTextTheme` styles in the Flutter application.  It details a text style conversion algorithm, emphasizing the mandatory inclusion of color from comments in `TextStyle` and the prohibition of additional style properties (`height`, `letterSpacing`, etc.) during conversion using `copyWith`.  The document undergoes multiple revisions, primarily clarifying the text style conversion algorithm and adding examples of correct and incorrect conversions, including adding a validation checklist to ensure the conversion steps are followed.  The main change is the finalization of the algorithm:  always include color but never include height or letter spacing in the conversion.

In summary, the code changes reflect a concerted effort to standardize typography in a Flutter project by defining a mapping between Figma design specifications and the application's styling framework.  The `KnowledgeBasement` widget and its related components are created or significantly improved to incorporate the new style guidelines.
