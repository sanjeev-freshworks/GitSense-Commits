# Activity Summary for 6/27/2025

## 11:22:42 AM
The log shows two edits to the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/my_prompt.prompt.md`.  Both edits, occurring within a minute of each other (10:38:13 AM and 10:38:25 AM on June 27th, 2025), relate to displaying date and time information in Flutter.  The first entry asks about displaying a date, while the second asks about implementing a date and time picker.  The pattern suggests a user is working on a Flutter application requiring date and time functionality and is iteratively refining their prompt or request.


## 1:22:47 PM
The log shows a series of code changes related to the Freshservice mobile application, focusing on code generation for data and presentation layers.  Several `.prompt.md` files detail instructions for generating Flutter code based on user input and design documents.  These prompts guide the code generation process, specifying requirements for data models, API interactions, and UI components (UIState, UIEvent, NavigationState).

Between 12:53 PM and 1:02 PM, there were multiple nearly identical entries updating `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md`. These revisions seem to be minor edits, likely refining the instructions for code generation related to an "approval_lib" module.  The consistent updates suggest iterative refinement of the prompt to ensure accuracy and completeness before code generation. The changes involve specifying the API information source for a data layer code generation task.  Initially, the API information was sourced from an `.md` file. Later versions added a `.json` file as a supplementary source.


At 12:57 PM, a major prompt file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/data_layer_codegen.prompt.md`, was updated. This prompt outlines a more comprehensive data layer code generation process, encompassing a detailed user input gathering process, parsing of CURL commands, confirmation steps, and a structured code generation sequence.  This suggests a shift towards a more robust and user-friendly code generation workflow.


At 1:05 PM, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/copilot-instructions.md` was updated, providing a high-level overview of the Freshservice Flutter codebase's architecture, technologies used, and coding guidelines.  This document emphasizes Clean Architecture, BLoC pattern, and specific package management tools. It also outlines detailed instructions for the AI assistant to follow during code generation, ensuring adherence to the project's architectural and coding standards.


At 1:06 PM, a `mapper` file (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/approval_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/mapper/request/get_requester_approvals_query_mapper.dart`) was created or updated twice in quick succession. This file's content suggests it maps query parameters for retrieving requester approvals to the format needed for API calls.  The repetition suggests a brief interruption or possible accidental double execution of the code generation process, resulting in the second nearly identical update.


Finally, between 1:08 PM and 1:11 PM, there were several updates to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/presentation/model/generic_presentation_layer_models_codegen_prompt_usage.md` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/presentation/model/generic_presentation_layer_models_codegen.prompt.md`. This suggests the setup for generating presentation layer models (UIState, UIEvent, NavigationState), possibly using information from a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and a Technical Design Document.  The structure of the prompts emphasizes a step-by-step approach, ensuring correctness and allowing for user review and feedback during each step.  Additional prompts related to BLoC code generation were added at 1:16 PM.

In summary, the log depicts a systematic and well-documented process of generating Flutter code for the Freshservice application, employing a clean architecture and leveraging AI assistance. The repeated updates and detailed instructions in the prompt files indicate an iterative development and refinement process, aiming for a robust and maintainable codebase.
