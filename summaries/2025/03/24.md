# Activity Summary for 3/24/2025

## 10:09:51 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Python script (`mitmProxySample.py`)  that uses `mitmproxy` to intercept and modify HTTP responses.  The primary focus is on modifying responses related to HDFC Bank APIs.  The most significant changes happen between 9:30 PM and 9:51 PM on March 24th, 2025.

The script contains several classes:

* **`ChangeHTTPCode`**: This class appears to be an early version or a placeholder, with commented-out code suggesting it originally modified response codes or content but is not actively used in later revisions.

* **`WalletBalanceChange`**: This class intercepts responses from a specific HDFC Bank API endpoint related to wallet closure status and modifies the response to set `"isBlocked"`, `"isDormant"`, and `"state"` fields to specific values ("true", "true", and "CLOSED" respectively).  The filter used is switched between a UAT (User Acceptance Testing) environment and a production environment across different log entries.

* **`OtpFilter`**: This class currently has empty filters for sending and verifying OTPs (One-Time Passwords). It sets the status code to 200.

* **`InterceptPayzapp`**: This is the main class in later revisions. It contains multiple functions (`directlyChangeRupayEligibility`, `directlyHandleUniversesDetails`, `directlyHandleFetchNominee`) that intercept various API requests and return custom responses.  It significantly modifies the responses for:
    * `"nudge/rupayCreditCardEligibility"`: Sets eligibility to `true`.
    * `"universesDetails"`: Provides a detailed JSON response with information about linked cards.  The response content is modified slightly between log entries. This function also changes the `linkedHdfcCard` and `linkedNonHdfcCard`  properties for non-prepaid cards.
    * `"/nominee"` (GET requests): Returns a JSON array of nominee details, with one entry filled out and another incomplete, indicating the ability to mock various data states.  The response status code changed between log entries (from 200 to 400).
    * `"get/creditCard/summary"`: Returns a mock credit card summary.
    * `"closure/status"`: Modifies the response to set `"isBlocked"` to `false` and `"blockedBy"` to `"ISSUER"`.
    * `"/verifyCardDetails"`: Returns a successful card verification response.
    * Handles 422 and 429 response codes changing them to 200.

The `addons` variable at the end of the script consistently selects `InterceptPayzapp` as the active addon, indicating the final version of the script uses this class for its interception logic.  The commented-out code suggests earlier versions utilized the other classes.  The overall pattern shows an evolution from modifying specific fields to comprehensively mocking different API responses for testing and development purposes.
