# Activity Summary for 3/28/2025

## 8:18:44 PM
The mitmProxySample.py file contains code for intercepting and modifying HTTP responses.  The key change between the two timestamps (3/28/2025, 4:54:13 PM and 3/28/2025, 4:54:39 PM) is minimal; only a comment was removed from the `WalletBalanceChange` class.


The code defines several classes: `ChangeHTTPCode`, `WalletBalanceChange`, `OtpFilter`, and `InterceptPayzapp`.  `InterceptPayzapp` is the main class used, with several functions that intercept specific API calls.

* **`InterceptPayzapp`**: This class intercepts and modifies responses for various API endpoints.  It handles:
    * `nudge/rupayCreditCardEligibility`: Sets the `eligible` field to `true`.
    * `universesDetails`:  Provides a hardcoded JSON response containing details of multiple payment instruments (prepaid, credit, and debit cards).  Note that the response is different than the one in `handleUniversesDetails` method.
    * `/nominee` (GET requests only): Returns a hardcoded JSON response containing nominee data.  The response status code is set to 400.
    * `get/creditCard/summary`: Provides a hardcoded JSON response for credit card summary.
    * `closure/status`: Modifies the response to set `isBlocked` to `false` and `blockedBy` to "ISSUER".
    * `/verifyCardDetails`: Provides a hardcoded JSON response indicating successful card verification.
    *  It also intercepts and changes HTTP status codes 422 and 429 to 200.

The code uses a filter-based approach; each function checks if the request URL contains a specific string before modifying the response.  The `ctx.log.warn` function is extensively used for logging the interception and modification process.  The code primarily deals with modifying JSON responses by parsing, modifying, and re-serializing the JSON data. There is a repeated pattern of intercepting requests, loading JSON content, modifying the JSON data, and then sending a modified JSON response.  The `universesDetails` endpoint is handled in two different ways, once directly in the `request` method and once in the `response` method, with slight differences in the returned JSON.
