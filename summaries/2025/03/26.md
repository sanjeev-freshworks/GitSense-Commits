# Activity Summary for 3/26/2025

## 12:57:30 PM
The `mitmProxySample.py` file, last modified on 3/26/2025 at 12:15:55 PM, contains several classes designed to intercept and modify HTTP responses using mitmproxy.  The core functionality revolves around manipulating JSON responses based on URL filters.

The `ChangeHTTPCode` and `WalletBalanceChange` classes demonstrate modifying specific JSON fields (`isDormant`, `isBlocked`, `state`, `balance`) within responses matching particular UAT and production URLs related to wallet closure status.  These changes alter the response's JSON content.

The `OtpFilter` class is present but currently inactive, as its filters are empty strings.

The primary functionality resides within the `InterceptPayzapp` class. This class features several methods (`directlyChangeRupayEligibility`, `directlyHandleUniversesDetails`, `directlyHandleFetchNominee`, `directlyHandleFetchNomineePatchRequest`) that intercept requests to specific URLs.  These functions modify the response content before it reaches the client, simulating different scenarios such as Rupay eligibility, universes details, and nominee data retrieval.  Specifically, `directlyHandleUniversesDetails` and `directlyHandleFetchNominee` provide custom JSON responses instead of forwarding requests to the server. `directlyHandleFetchNomineePatchRequest` is a stub and doesn't actually modify the response.  The `response` method within `InterceptPayzapp` calls other methods to handle various API endpoints, including:  `get/creditCard/summary`, `closure/status`, `/verifyCardDetails`, `universesDetails`, and modifying responses with status codes 422 and 429.  Many of these methods modify the response status code to 200 and alter JSON data to provide modified responses based on pre-defined templates.  A significant portion of the code is dedicated to handling and modifying details about linked cards including details like payment type, expiry date, and status. The final line of the code currently sets `addons` to only include `InterceptPayzapp`, making this the active class.  There's evidence of previous iterations where different classes were active, indicated by commented-out code.
