# Activity Summary for 10/15/2025

## 7:50:13 AM
The changes primarily affect the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`.

The evolution of this file, specifically the `FSFormItemAttachmentField` widget, shows a clear pattern of refining the integration and scope of `BlocProvider` for state management using `ItilFormAttachmentBloc`.

**Key Timestamps and Changes:**

*   **10/15/2025, 7:23:07 AM:** The initial state of the code had the `BlocProvider` for `ItilFormAttachmentBloc` defined within the `_buildAttachmentItemPreview` widget. The `buildField` method directly returned a `Column`.
*   **10/15/2025, 7:30:20 AM:** A significant structural change occurred. The `BlocProvider` was moved to wrap the entire `Column` within the `buildField` method. However, a redundant `BlocProvider` was still present in `_buildAttachmentItemPreview`.
*   **10/15/2025, 7:30:32 AM:** This entry immediately corrected the redundancy introduced in the previous step. The `BlocProvider` was removed from `_buildAttachmentItemPreview`, making the top-level `BlocProvider` in `buildField` the sole provider for `ItilFormAttachmentBloc` within this widget's scope. `_buildAttachmentItemPreview` now directly returns a `BlocBuilder`.
*   **10/15/2025, 7:49:24 AM:** A `Builder` widget was introduced as a direct child of the root `BlocProvider` in `buildField`. This `Builder` provides a new `BuildContext` (named `blocContext`) which is a descendant of the `BlocProvider`. This `blocContext` is then consistently used when invoking `AttachmentPickerUiHelper.getAttachFilesTitle`, `_showAttachmentPicker`, and `_buildAttachmentItemPreview`. This pattern ensures that any widget or method requiring access to the `ItilFormAttachmentBloc` (e.g., via `context.read<ItilFormAttachmentBloc>()`) receives a `BuildContext` that is properly within the bloc's scope, preventing potential "BlocProvider not found" errors.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Bloc State Management:** The primary pattern is the strategic placement and usage of `BlocProvider` and `BlocBuilder` for handling the state of attachment fields, specifically with `ItilFormAttachmentBloc`, `FSFormAttachmentEvent`, and `FSFormAttachmentState`.
*   **Attachment Handling:** The code consistently manages user interactions related to attachments:
    *   Displaying a button to attach files (`FSPlainButton`).
    *   Showing an attachment picker (`showAttachmentPicker`).
    *   Adding multiple attachments (`_addMultipleAttachments`).
    *   Removing individual attachments (`_removeAttachment`).
    *   Displaying a preview of attached items (`AttachmentItemPreviewRoot`).
*   **Error Reporting:** A dedicated `_showErrorAlert` method is used with `FSAlertDialog` for displaying user-friendly error messages related to attachment picking.
*   **Logging:** `FSLogger.logWithTag` is utilized for debugging, specifically to log when attachments are added or removed.
*   **Immutability:** When modifying the list of attachments, new lists are created (`List<AttachmentLocalFile>.from(model.attachments)`) and the `copyWith` method on the `model` is used to create an updated, immutable state.
*   **Localization:** `context.commonUILoc` is frequently accessed to retrieve localized strings for button texts, alert titles, and messages.
*   **UI Components:** Consistent use of custom UI components such as `FSPlainButton`, `FSImage`, `FSAlertDialog`, and design system constants like `space8`, `space12`, `CommonUIImages.icAttachBlue`.

## 9:41:46 AM
The code change log primarily focuses on the `fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart` file, with auxiliary updates to `fs_form_attachment_state.dart` and `itil_form_attachment_bloc.dart`. The changes revolve around handling attachment uploads within a Flutter application using the BLoC state management pattern, particularly observing and responding to `ItilFormAttachmentBloc` states.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`**
    *   **Initial Setup (10/15/2025, 8:43:48 AM):** This version establishes the `FSFormItemAttachmentField` widget. It includes UI elements for attaching files, a preview for attachments, and methods to add or remove attachments. The `_addMultipleAttachments` method dispatches an `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentAdded` to the BLoC. It sets up a `BlocListener` in `_buildAttachmentItemPreview` but refers to an undefined `_handleBlocStateChange` method.
    *   **Introduction of State Handling (10/15/2025, 8:44:00 AM):** The `_handleBlocStateChange` method is added, defining how the UI reacts to `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadSuccess` (showing a green `SnackBar`) and `FSFormAttachmentStateError` (showing an `FSAlertDialog`). A new `_showSuccessMessage` method is also introduced for this purpose.
    *   **Stream Listening Implemented (10/15/2025, 8:44:15 AM - 8:44:28 AM):** The `_addMultipleAttachments` method is modified to include a `bloc.stream.listen` block. This allows the widget to subscribe directly to the BLoC's stream to get immediate feedback on upload success or failure, logging the outcomes. The `import 'dart:async';` is explicitly added at 8:44:28 AM to support this asynchronous stream listening.
    *   **Major Revert (10/15/2025, 8:45:55 AM):** A significant change occurs here, reverting most of the reactive UI feedback logic. The `_handleBlocStateChange` and `_showSuccessMessage` methods are removed, the `BlocListener` is taken out of `_buildAttachmentItemPreview`, and the `bloc.stream.listen` logic within `_addMultipleAttachments` is also removed, along with the `dart:async` import. This suggests a decision to handle state updates differently or at a higher level.
    *   **Stream Listening Re-introduced with Iterative Logging Fixes (10/15/2025, 8:46:08 AM - 8:58:17 AM):** The `bloc.stream.listen` logic is re-introduced in `_addMultipleAttachments`. Following this re-introduction, there are several small, rapid changes to the logging statement within the `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadSuccess` block. These changes reflect an iterative process of correctly accessing and logging specific properties (`.`, `.file`, `.files[0].`, `.id`, `.attachment`, `.attachment.id`) from the `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadSuccess` object, indicating debugging efforts. Notably, the `import 'dart:async';` is missing again in these re-introduced versions, which would likely cause compilation issues.

2.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/model/fs_form_attachment_state.dart`**
    *   **State Model Definition (10/15/2025, 8:56:52 AM):** This entry explicitly defines the `FSFormAttachmentState` sealed class and its concrete states. `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadSuccess` is shown to hold an `ItilAttachment` object (named `attachment`), while `FSFormAttachmentStateError` holds a `FormAttachmentFieldType` object (named `file`) and a `message`. This definition clarifies the expected data structures for different upload outcomes.

3.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/itil_form_attachment_bloc.dart`**
    *   **Bloc Implementation (10/15/2025, 8:57:07 AM - 8:57:18 AM):** This file defines the `ItilFormAttachmentBloc`. It's responsible for orchestrating the file upload using an `UploadFileToItilUseCase`. The `uploadAttachment` method emits `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading` and `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadSuccess`. Crucially, it contains `// fixme` comments, indicating that the error handling and full success state management are still pending or incomplete.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **10/15/2025, 8:44:00 AM:** Introduction of UI feedback mechanisms (`_handleBlocStateChange`, `_showSuccessMessage`) and initial `BlocListener` setup in `fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`.
*   **10/15/2025, 8:44:15 AM - 8:44:28 AM:** Implementation of direct BLoC stream listening within `_addMultipleAttachments` for granular state observation in `fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`, completed by adding `import 'dart:async';`.
*   **10/15/2025, 8:45:55 AM:** A major rollback in `fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`, removing direct UI feedback, `BlocListener`, and stream listening logic.
*   **10/15/2025, 8:46:08 AM:** Re-introduction of direct BLoC stream listening in `_addMultipleAttachments` in `fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart` (though missing its required import).
*   **10/15/2025, 8:56:52 AM:** Definition of `FSFormAttachmentState` structure, clarifying the `attachment` field for success states and `file` for error states.
*   **10/15/2025, 8:58:06 AM:** Final iterative refinement to the logging statement within the stream listener in `fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`, correctly attempting to log `state.attachment.id`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **BLoC Pattern Usage:** All changes consistently use the BLoC pattern for state management, involving `BlocProvider`, `BlocListener`, `BlocBuilder`, dispatching `BlocEvents`, and emitting `BlocStates`.
*   **Iterative Development/Debugging:** The `fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart` file shows a strong pattern of iterative refinement, especially concerning how BLoC state changes are observed and logged. This includes implementing a feature, reverting it, and then re-implementing it with debugging attempts visible in logging statements.
*   **Missing Imports:** A recurring issue in the log entries for `fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart` (after the initial stream listener introduction) is the presence of `StreamSubscription` and `Future.delayed` without the necessary `import 'dart:async';`, indicating that some logged states might represent uncompilable work-in-progress snapshots.
*   **`// fixme` Comments:** The `itil_form_attachment_bloc.dart` consistently includes `// fixme` comments, signaling incomplete logic or placeholders for future enhancements, particularly around comprehensive error and success state handling.
*   **Logging for Observability:** `FSLogger.logWithTag` is extensively used across files to trace execution flow and state changes, particularly for attachment upload events and results.

## 10:47:34 AM
The changes log details a series of closely timed updates focused on form field rendering and attachment handling within a Flutter application. The primary areas of modification are the `journey_lib` and `form_lib` libraries, particularly concerning how attachment fields are displayed and managed.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/journey_form_detail_activity_form.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** The earliest log entry for this file is **10/15/2025, 10:06:16 AM**, with subsequent rapid updates at **10:06:31 AM**, **10:06:45 AM**, and **10:06:57 AM**. This indicates a focused iteration on this specific component.
    *   **Content:** This `StatefulWidget`, `JourneyFormDetailActivityForm`, is responsible for building a form based on `JourneyActivityFormUIModel`. It dynamically renders form fields using a `switch` expression.
    *   Initially, the `FormAttachmentFieldUIModel` case in the `_buildFormField` method was present but its associated `_buildAttachmentField` method was likely a placeholder or incomplete.
    *   Through the subsequent updates (10:06:31 AM, 10:06:45 AM, 10:06:57 AM), the `_buildAttachmentField` method was progressively refined. It was initially defined incorrectly, then had its parameter list adjusted (e.g., from `_buildAttachmentField(context)` to `_buildAttachmentField(context, f)`), and finally corrected to `_buildAttachmentField(BuildContext context, FormFieldUIModel model)`.
    *   The final version of `_buildAttachmentField` in this file correctly instantiates `FSFormItemAttachmentField`, passing the `model` (cast as `FormAttachmentFieldUIModel`) and `widget.onFormFieldValueChanged` for handling changes.
    *   The widget also includes logic to manage `GlobalKey`s for each form field and implements scrolling to specific fields via `FSScrollToFormFieldNotifier`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/components/fs_form_common_field.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** **10/15/2025, 10:07:05 AM**. This change occurred shortly after the initial set of updates to `journey_form_detail_activity_form.dart`.
    *   **Content:** The `FSFormCommonField` `StatelessWidget` was updated to explicitly handle `FormAttachmentFieldUIModel`. Previously, this might have fallen into a default case.
    *   A new private method, `_buildAttachmentField(BuildContext context)`, was added to `FSFormCommonField`, which now returns an `FSFormAttachmentField` (distinct from `FSFormItemAttachmentField`). This suggests a clear separation or two different types of attachment field widgets.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** **10/15/2025, 10:11:32 AM**. This significant update provides the implementation for the `FSFormItemAttachmentField` used in `journey_form_detail_activity_form.dart`.
    *   **Content:** This file defines a specialized attachment field widget that extends `FSFormBaseField`. It provides UI for attaching files, using `AttachmentPickerUiHelper` to open an attachment picker.
    *   It integrates with `ItilFormAttachmentBloc` via `BlocProvider` and `BlocBuilder` to manage attachment state, including adding and removing attachments.
    *   The `_addMultipleAttachments` method demonstrates how new attachments are added to the model and an `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentAdded` event is dispatched to the bloc. It also attempts to subscribe to the bloc's stream to monitor upload success/failure, though it includes a `Future.delayed` for subscription cancellation.
    *   Error handling for the attachment picker is also present, displaying an `FSAlertDialog` for issues.
    *   A static `_attachmentBlocContext` is used to access the bloc, which is an uncommon pattern and could indicate specific lifecycle management requirements.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/itil_form_attachment_bloc.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** **10/15/2025, 10:17:10 AM**. This change closely follows the `FSFormItemAttachmentField` implementation, providing the necessary bloc logic.
    *   **Content:** This file defines `ItilFormAttachmentBloc`, which extends `FSFormBaseAttachmentBloc`.
    *   Its primary responsibility is to handle the uploading of ITIL-specific attachments using an injected `_uploadFileToItilUseCase`.
    *   The `uploadAttachment` method emits `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading` and `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadSuccess`.
    *   Notably, there are `// fixme` comments in the `uploadAttachment` method, indicating that error handling and potentially full state management for success/error states are still incomplete or need refinement.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **UI Model Driven Development:** The application heavily relies on UI models (e.g., `FormFieldUIModel`, `FormAttachmentFieldUIModel`, `JourneyActivityFormUIModel`) to drive widget rendering and state.
*   **Bloc Pattern for State Management:** `flutter_bloc` is extensively used for managing complex state, particularly for attachment handling (`ItilFormAttachmentBloc`). `context.read` is a common pattern for bloc access.
*   **Dynamic Form Field Rendering:** `switch` expressions are a recurring pattern for conditionally rendering different form field widgets based on the `FormFieldUIModel` type.
*   **Attachment Handling Focus:** A significant portion of these changes is dedicated to implementing a robust attachment feature, distinguishing between a generic `FSFormAttachmentField` and a more specific `FSFormItemAttachmentField` tied to an ITIL attachment bloc.
*   **Lifecycle Management:** Widgets frequently implement `initState`, `didUpdateWidget`, and `dispose` for managing listeners and initializations.
*   **Logging:** `fs_logger` is used for debugging and tracking events (`FSLogger.logWithTag`).
*   **Incomplete Features/Known Issues:** The presence of `// fixme` comments in `ItilFormAttachmentBloc` indicates that certain aspects, like comprehensive error state handling, are still under development or pending.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The very close timestamps for updates to `journey_form_detail_activity_form.dart` suggest an intense period of development or refactoring on that specific component.

In summary, these changes collectively refine the handling and display of form fields, with a particular emphasis on introducing a specialized attachment field (`FSFormItemAttachmentField`) that leverages a Bloc for managing attachment uploads, specifically for ITIL-related contexts. The updates also reveal an ongoing development process with noted areas for future improvements.

## 11:47:30 AM
The code changes reflect a focused development effort on attachment handling within the Freshservice mobile Flutter application, specifically for ITIL forms. All modifications occurred on **October 15, 2025**, within a span of roughly ninety minutes, indicating a concentrated session.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/itil_form_attachment_bloc.dart**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/15/2025, 10:57:42 AM**: The initial setup of `ItilFormAttachmentBloc` was established. It extended `FSFormBaseAttachmentBloc` and utilized `UploadFileToItilUseCase` for uploading. The `uploadAttachment` method was designed to emit `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading` and `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadSuccess`, with an initial state of `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading()`.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/15/2025, 11:04:15 AM**: A minor but significant change was made to the bloc's initialization, updating the initial state passed to the super constructor from `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading()` to `FSFormAttachmentStateInitial()`.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/model/fs_form_attachment_state.dart**
    *   This file underwent numerous rapid changes between **10:59:13 AM and 11:01:58 AM**.
    *   Initially, `FSFormAttachmentState` introduced an incomplete `List<AttachmentLoca` type.
    *   A significant refactoring then introduced a required `final AttachmentLocalFile file` property to the base `sealed class FSFormAttachmentState`.
    *   Subsequently, all concrete state subclasses (`FSFormAttachmentStateInitial`, `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading`, `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadSuccess`, `FSFormAttachmentStateError`) were updated in successive commits to explicitly accept and pass this `file` to their `super` constructor, ensuring consistency across the state hierarchy.
    *   The `FSFormAttachmentStateError` class also had its `file` parameter (of type `FormAttachmentFieldType`) renamed to `attachmentFieldType` for better clarity.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/fields/itil_attachment_field_ui_model.dart**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/15/2025, 11:02:30 AM**: Introduced `ItilAttachmentFieldUIModel` with a `states` list. The constructor initially had a mismatch, requiring `files` which was not a member.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/15/2025, 11:02:42 AM**: The constructor was quickly corrected to align with its member variable, requiring `states` instead of `files`. Both versions contained a `fixme` comment about future requirements.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart**
    *   This file saw significant refactoring regarding the placement of Bloc logic between **11:11:22 AM and 11:12:10 AM**.
    *   Initially, it hosted a `BlocProvider` and `BlocBuilder` for `ItilFormAttachmentBloc` within its `_buildAttachmentItemPreview` method, including commented-out code for bloc stream subscription.
    *   Progressively, the Bloc-related wrapping was commented out entirely from `_buildAttachmentItemPreview` (11:11:42 AM) and then the `_buildAttachmentItemPreview` method call itself was replaced by a direct `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` usage in the main `buildField` method (11:12:10 AM). This indicates a move to delegate Bloc-related responsibilities further down the widget tree.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/attachment/attachment_item_preview_root.dart**
    *   This new file was introduced between **11:24:55 AM and 11:25:21 AM**.
    *   It now takes over the `BlocProvider` and `BlocBuilder` responsibilities for `ItilFormAttachmentBloc`, embedding them within its `_buildAttachmentItemPreview` method, which is responsible for rendering individual `AttachmentItemPreview` widgets.
    *   Several quick corrections were made to fix syntax errors in `fsDIComponent.get()` to correctly specify the generic type `ItilFormAttachmentBloc`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Attachment Feature Development**: All changes are centered around implementing and refining attachment upload and display functionality, particularly within forms.
*   **Flutter Bloc State Management**: There's a consistent focus on integrating and restructuring the Flutter Bloc pattern, specifically for managing the state of attachment uploads (`ItilFormAttachmentBloc` and `FSFormAttachmentState`).
*   **State Class Standardization**: The `FSFormAttachmentState` sealed class underwent a significant refactoring to enforce a common `AttachmentLocalFile` parameter across all its subclasses, improving data consistency.
*   **Architectural Refactoring (UI/Bloc Separation)**: A clear pattern emerged where Bloc-related logic was initially placed high in the `FSFormItemAttachmentField` widget but then progressively moved down to the `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` component. This suggests an architectural decision to localize bloc responsibilities closer to the UI elements they directly manage (i.e., individual attachment previews).
*   **"fixme" Comments**: The presence of "fixme" comments in `itil_form_attachment_bloc.dart` and `itil_attachment_field_ui_model.dart` indicates ongoing development, particularly around error handling and determining required fields.

## 12:47:51 PM
The provided log details significant refactoring and feature implementation related to attachment handling within a Freshservice Flutter mobile application, primarily focusing on `common_ui` and `form_lib` libraries. The changes, observed over approximately an hour and a half on October 15, 2025, involve the display, management, and upload of `AttachmentLocalFile` objects using the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/attachment/attachment_item_preview_root.dart`**
    *   **Initial Structure (10/15, 11:49:20 AM):** Began as a `StatelessWidget` responsible for displaying a list of `AttachmentLocalFile`s, with a placeholder for individual item rendering.
    *   **Early Refinement (10/15, 11:49:46 AM):** The internal method `_buildAttachmentItemPreview` was removed, and the list directly mapped to `AttachmentItemPreview` widgets.
    *   **BLoC Integration (10/15, 11:52:47 AM onwards):** Underwent a major refactor to integrate BLoC for individual attachment item states. Each `AttachmentItemPreview` within the list became wrapped in a `BlocProvider` and `BlocBuilder` for `ItilFormAttachmentBloc`. This setup allows each attachment to display a `CircularProgressIndicator` when in `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading` or the `AttachmentItemPreview` when in other states.
    *   **Attachment Upload Initiation (10/15, 12:04:26 PM):** A crucial `_sendAttachmentAddedEvent` method was introduced. This method is called via `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback` when an `AttachmentItemPreview` is built, explicitly dispatching an `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentAdded` event for the individual attachment to its dedicated `ItilFormAttachmentBloc`. It also sets up a `StreamSubscription` to listen for `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadSuccess` or `FSFormAttachmentStateError` to cancel the subscription, with a 30-second fallback timeout.
    *   **Refinement of Subscription Handling (10/15, 12:14:12 PM):** The stream subscription was modified to explicitly cancel itself immediately upon receiving either a success or error state, rather than relying solely on the timeout.
    *   **Import Addition (10/15, 12:14:25 PM):** `dart:async` was imported to support `StreamSubscription`.

2.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (10/15, 11:50:47 AM):** This component was responsible for presenting an attachment field in a form, including a button to add files (`FSPlainButton`) and displaying previews using `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot`. It initially held BLoC logic for individual attachments, including storing `_attachmentBlocContext` and dispatching `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentAdded` in `_addMultipleAttachments`, complete with stream listening for upload status.
    *   **Delegation of BLoC Logic (10/15, 11:52:25 AM):** The BLoC-related UI and state management for individual attachments were removed from `_buildAttachmentItemPreview` in this file, indicating a clear delegation of this responsibility to `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot`.
    *   **Cleanup and Decoupling (10/15, 12:00:18 PM):** All remaining BLoC-specific imports, the `_attachmentBlocContext`, and the logic for dispatching attachment added events and listening to streams were entirely removed from `_addMultipleAttachments`. This confirms that `FSFormItemAttachmentField` now focuses solely on managing the list of attachments at a higher level and triggering the picker, while `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` handles the state and upload for each individual attachment.

3.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/fs_form_base_attachment_bloc.dart`**
    *   **Introduction (10/15, 11:59:26 AM):** A new abstract base class `FSFormBaseAttachmentBloc` was introduced, providing common functionality for attachment BLoCs. It defines event handlers for `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentAdded`, `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentRemoved`, and `FSFormAttachmentEventOnRetry`, delegating the actual upload to an abstract `uploadAttachment` method.
    *   **Constructor Cleanup (10/15, 12:01:30 PM):** A problematic, incomplete `add()` call in the constructor was commented out.

4.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/model/fs_form_attachment_state.dart`**
    *   **Initial Definition (10/15, 12:24:34 PM):** Defined `FSFormAttachmentState` as a sealed class with states like `Initial`, `Loading`, `UploadSuccess`, and `Error`, each carrying relevant data (`file`, `attachment`, `message`).
    *   **Refinement of `file` Property (10/15, 12:37:14 PM & 12:40:51 PM):** The `AttachmentLocalFile file` property was initially moved to the base `FSFormAttachmentState` but then reverted. The final structure places the `file` property in `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading`, `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadSuccess`, and `FSFormAttachmentStateError`, while `FSFormAttachmentStateInitial` does not require a `file`.

5.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/itil_form_attachment_bloc.dart`**
    *   **Implementation (10/15, 12:25:31 PM onwards):** Implemented `ItilFormAttachmentBloc` extending `FSFormBaseAttachmentBloc`. Its `uploadAttachment` method is designed to use an `UploadFileToItilUseCase`.
    *   **In-progress State Management (10/15, 12:27:52 PM - 12:45:41 PM):** Multiple attempts were made to correctly pass the `AttachmentLocalFile` to the `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading` emission and to extract the file from the `FormAttachmentFieldTypeItilAttachment` for the `UploadFileToItilUseCase`. This section of the log shows ongoing development, with incomplete code (`fixme` comments, partial accessors like `.states[0].`) and iterative changes, particularly around looping through attachment states, indicating a struggle to handle the file extraction and state emission correctly for potentially multiple files within an event.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/15/2025, 11:49:46 AM:** `attachment_item_preview_root.dart` refactored to directly use `AttachmentItemPreview`.
*   **10/15/2025, 11:52:25 AM:** `fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart` delegated individual attachment BLoC logic.
*   **10/15/2025, 11:52:47 AM:** `attachment_item_preview_root.dart` incorporated `BlocProvider` and `BlocBuilder` for individual attachments.
*   **10/15/2025, 11:59:26 AM:** `fs_form_base_attachment_bloc.dart` abstract base class was introduced.
*   **10/15/2025, 12:00:18 PM:** `fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart` completed decoupling from individual attachment BLoC logic.
*   **10/15/2025, 12:04:26 PM:** `attachment_item_preview_root.dart` implemented event dispatching for attachment uploads upon widget creation.
*   **10/15/2025, 12:25:31 PM:** `itil_form_attachment_bloc.dart` first iteration of the specific attachment upload BLoC.
*   **10/15/2025, 12:40:51 PM:** `fs_form_attachment_state.dart` finalized its state hierarchy regarding the `file` property.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **BLoC Pattern Reinforcement:** The changes consistently show a move towards a more granular and decoupled BLoC architecture for attachment management, with a base bloc and specific implementations (`ItilFormAttachmentBloc`).
*   **Separation of Concerns:** There's a clear refactoring effort to separate the concerns of displaying the overall attachment field (`FSFormItemAttachmentField`) from managing the state and upload lifecycle of individual attachment items (`AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` and its embedded BLoC).
*   **Asynchronous Operations & State Handling:** The extensive use of `BlocProvider`, `BlocBuilder`, events, and states (Loading, Success, Error) highlights the handling of asynchronous operations (file uploads) and UI updates based on their progress.
*   **Logging for Debugging:** `FSLogger.logWithTag` is a recurring element, indicating a practice of comprehensive logging for tracking application flow and debugging, especially around BLoC events and state transitions.
*   **Incomplete/Iterative Development:** Several `fixme` comments and partial code snippets (e.g., `attachment.itilAttachmentFieldUIModel.states[0].,`) suggest an active development process where features are being built and refined iteratively, with some parts not yet fully functional or complete within the scope of these logs. This is particularly evident in `ItilFormAttachmentBloc`.

## 1:51:45 PM
The log details a series of iterative changes focused on refining the attachment handling mechanism within a Flutter application's form library, particularly for ITIL attachments. The changes span several related files, indicating a concentrated effort to update the data model, event structure, and BLoC logic for file uploads.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp of significant changes:** Frequent modifications occurred between **10/15/2025, 12:50:01 PM** and **12:57:57 PM**.
    *   **Key Updates:** This file underwent numerous minor corrections and refactorings in how new attachments are added and processed. Initially, there were attempts to pass a list of `AttachmentLocalFile` directly or indirectly via an incorrectly structured `ItilAttachmentFieldUIModel`.
    *   A significant refinement occurred around **12:55:34 PM** to **12:57:57 PM**, where the logic for creating `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentAdded` events was corrected. Instead of trying to put a list of files into a single UI model, it now maps each `AttachmentLocalFile` (from `newAttachments`) to an individual `FormAttachmentFieldTypeItilAttachment`, which in turn contains an `ItilAttachmentFieldUIModel` holding a single `AttachmentLocalFile`. This change directly correlates with the data model update in `itil_attachment_field_ui_model.dart`.

2.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/model/fs_form_attachment_event.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp of significant change:** **10/15/2025, 12:51:15 PM**.
    *   **Key Update:** The `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentAdded` event was modified to accept `final List<AttachmentType> attachment;`, indicating a shift to handling multiple attachments as a list within a single event.

3.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/fields/itil_attachment_field_ui_model.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp of significant changes:** Changes between **10/15/2025, 12:52:02 PM** and **12:57:23 PM**.
    *   **Key Updates:** Initially, this model had a `files` property of type `List<AttachmentLocalFile>`.
    *   **Significant Change (10/15/2025, 12:57:13 PM):** The `files` property was changed from a list to a single `AttachmentLocalFile`.
    *   **Minor Refinement (10/15/2025, 12:57:23 PM):** The property was then renamed from `files` to `file` (`final AttachmentLocalFile file;`) for better clarity.

4.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/fs_form_base_attachment_bloc.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp of significant changes:** Changes between **10/15/2025, 12:59:32 PM** and **1:03:50 PM**.
    *   **Key Update:** A new `retryUploadAttachment` method was introduced around **10/15/2025, 1:00:28 PM**. This method takes a single `AttachmentType` and internally calls the `uploadAttachment` method (which expects a list). The `FSFormAttachmentEventOnRetry` event handler was updated to use this new retry logic.

5.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/itil_form_attachment_bloc.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp of significant changes:** Extensive modifications occurred between **10/15/2025, 1:01:29 PM** and **1:05:38 PM**.
    *   **Key Updates:** The `uploadAttachment` method underwent a complete overhaul. Initial versions contained logical and syntax errors when trying to access attachment data.
    *   **Significant Refactoring (10/15/2025, 1:03:28 PM):** The method was refactored to correctly iterate through the list of `FormAttachmentFieldTypeItilAttachment` objects, emit `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading` for each, call the `_uploadFileToItilUseCase` with the individual `AttachmentLocalFile`, and then emit either `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadSuccess` or `FSFormAttachmentStateError` based on the use case result.
    *   **Significant Change (10/15/2025, 1:04:09 PM):** The return type of `uploadAttachment` was changed from `Future<UCResult>` to `Future<List<UCResult>>`, reflecting the intention to handle and report results for multiple individual file uploads.
    *   **Finalization (10/15/2025, 1:05:38 PM):** The method was updated to collect all individual `UCResult` instances into a list and return them, completing the multi-upload handling logic.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Iterative Development and Debugging:** The log entries show a pattern of frequent, small changes, often correcting syntax errors (e.g., `FSFormAttachmentState` as a value, `toElement` undefined), adjusting parameter types, and refining logic. This suggests an active development phase with immediate testing and corrections.
*   **BLoC Architecture Integration:** The changes consistently revolve around the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern, managing states (`FSFormAttachmentState`), events (`FSFormAttachmentEvent`), and `BlocProvider`/`BlocBuilder` usage.
*   **Logger Usage:** `FSLogger.logWithTag` is used extensively across multiple files, indicating a strong emphasis on logging for debugging and tracing the flow of attachment events and states.
*   **Refactoring for Multi-File Handling:** A central theme is the evolution from potentially ambiguous or single-file focused attachment handling to a more robust mechanism for managing multiple attachments, where each attachment is processed individually but initiated by a single "add multiple" event. This involved changing the `ItilAttachmentFieldUIModel` to represent a single file and adapting event parameters and BLoC logic accordingly.
*   **Error and Success State Management:** There's a consistent pattern of emitting `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading`, `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadSuccess`, and `FSFormAttachmentStateError` to represent the various stages and outcomes of an attachment upload operation.
*   **"fixme" Comments:** Several "fixme" comments indicate areas identified for future improvement or remaining issues during this development phase.

## 3:02:31 PM
`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/itil_form_attachment_bloc.dart`
This file saw several rapid updates between 2:12 PM and 2:16 PM on 10/15/2025. Initially, the `uploadAttachment` method correctly handled a list of `FormAttachmentFieldTypeItilAttachment` objects. A brief change at 2:13:05 PM removed an `await` keyword from a `_uploadFileToItilUseCase` call, which was quickly reverted at 2:13:16 PM. Significant refactoring began at 2:15:26 PM, changing the `uploadAttachment` method's parameter type to `List<FormAttachmentFieldType>`. This initially led to type incompatibility errors as the internal logic still expected the more specific `FormAttachmentFieldTypeItilAttachment`. This was addressed at 2:15:51 PM by explicitly filtering and casting the incoming `itilAttachments` back to `FormAttachmentFieldTypeItilAttachment` before processing them. The core functionality of emitting loading and success states during file upload using `_uploadFileToItilUseCase` remained consistent throughout these modifications.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/fs_form_base_attachment_bloc.dart`
This base attachment BLoC file was modified between 2:13 PM and 2:14 PM on 10/15/2025. At 2:14:22 PM, the `retryUploadAttachment` method's return type was updated from `Future<UCResult>` to `Future<List<UCResult>>` to align with the `uploadAttachment` method it invokes. Subsequently, at 2:14:37 PM, the `uploadAttachment` method's parameter type was generalized from `List<FormAttachmentFieldTypeItilAttachment>` to `List<FormAttachmentFieldType>`, making the base BLoC more flexible for different attachment types. The BLoC is responsible for registering events for adding, removing, and retrying attachments, with log statements tracing these actions.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/base/fs_form_base_field.dart`
This file was significantly updated or introduced at 2:23:48 PM on 10/15/2025. It defines `FSFormBaseField`, an abstract `StatelessWidget` that provides a standard structure for form fields. This includes rendering a label, an abstract `buildField` method for specific field content, and a conditional display for error messages. It leverages `FormFieldUIUtil` for consistent styling of labels and errors.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`
This UI component file was updated around 2:30 PM on 10/15/2025. It defines `FSFormItemAttachmentField`, a widget for handling file attachments in a form. It integrates with `ItilFormAttachmentBloc` using `BlocProvider` and `BlocBuilder` to manage attachment upload states. A notable fix at 2:30:16 PM corrected a typo (`bcontext` to `context`) in the `_addMultipleAttachments` call within the `_showAttachmentPicker`'s success callback. The component displays a button to trigger the attachment picker, shows a preview of selected attachments, and includes logic for adding/removing attachments and displaying error alerts. It uses a static `_attachmentBlocContext` to dispatch BLoC events from different scopes.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/attachment/attachment_item_preview_root.dart`
This file saw multiple updates between 2:31 PM and 2:33 PM on 10/15/2025. Initially, it was a simple `StatelessWidget` for displaying a list of `AttachmentItemPreview` widgets. A significant architectural change occurred at 2:32:09 PM, where each individual `AttachmentItemPreview` widget was wrapped in its own `BlocProvider` for `ItilFormAttachmentBloc`, suggesting a move towards more granular state management per attachment. This required adding the relevant import at 2:32:17 PM. A temporary issue with duplicate imports at 2:33:00 PM was resolved by 2:33:26 PM, which also removed an unused `form_lib.dart` import.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The changes consistently revolve around attachment management within a Freshservice mobile application, leveraging the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management. There is a clear pattern of introducing base classes (`FSFormBaseAttachmentBloc`, `FSFormBaseField`) to establish common structure and behavior for UI components and business logic related to forms and attachments. Type safety and generics are a recurring theme, with several commits focusing on making method signatures more flexible while ensuring correct type handling (e.g., casting `FormAttachmentFieldType` to `FormAttachmentFieldTypeItilAttachment`). Logging via `FSLogger.logWithTag` is prevalent for debugging. The close timestamps across several changes suggest a period of rapid iteration, refactoring, and bug fixing, especially concerning type compatibility and BLoC integration for attachment uploads.

## 3:57:14 PM
The code changes primarily revolve around the attachment handling system within a Flutter application, focusing on UI components, state management using Flutter Bloc, and data models for attachments.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/attachment/attachment_item_preview_root.dart`**
    *   **Initial state (10/15/2025, 3:03:18 PM & 3:03:33 PM):** This widget was responsible for rendering a list of `AttachmentItemPreview` widgets. Each preview item was wrapped in its own `BlocProvider` for `ItilFormAttachmentBloc`.
    *   **Significant Refactor (10/15/2025, 3:10:11 PM):**
        *   The `_buildAttachmentsList` method was updated to integrate BLoC logic for managing loading and error states for individual attachments directly within `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot`.
        *   It now dispatches an `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentAdded` event for each attachment via a `_sendAttachmentAddedEvent` method, which is invoked using `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback`. This indicates that `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` is now initiating the attachment upload process and handling its immediate UI feedback (loading spinner).
        *   Imports for `core_ui`, `form_lib` models (`ItilAttachmentFieldUIModel`, `FormAttachmentFieldType`, `FSFormAttachmentEvent`, `FSFormAttachmentState`), and `fs_logger` were added.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/attachment/attachment_item_preview.dart`**
    *   **Initial state (10/15/2025, 3:03:56 PM):** This widget included `BlocBuilder` to react to `ItilFormAttachmentBloc` states, dynamically showing loading indicators, retry icons, or close icons, and dispatching retry events.
    *   **Minor UI tweaks (10/15/2025, 3:04:04 PM - 3:04:15 PM):** Changed `icRetry` to `icRetryIcon` and removed `const` keyword from `FSImage` constructors for retry and close icons.
    *   **Conditional BLoC Events (10/15/2025, 3:04:27 PM - 3:04:46 PM):** A `sendBlocEvents` boolean property was introduced to control whether BLoC events (retry/remove) were dispatched from this widget.
    *   **Major Simplification (10/15/2025, 3:04:52 PM):** All BLoC-related imports, the `BlocBuilder`, `sendBlocEvents` property, `_buildTrailingWidget`, and `_handleAttachmentAction` methods were removed. The trailing icon became a static close icon, and `onTap` directly called the `onPressed` callback. This change indicates a shift in responsibility, making `AttachmentItemPreview` a purely presentational component, with its state management moving to a higher-level widget (likely `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot`).

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`**
    *   **Initial state (10/15/2025, 3:10:45 PM):** This field handled showing an attachment picker, adding/removing attachments from its model, and integrating `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` within its own BLoC context to show loading states. It used a static `_attachmentBlocContext` to dispatch events to the `ItilFormAttachmentBloc`.
    *   **Temporary Comment-out (10/15/2025, 3:11:06 PM - 3:11:13 PM):** `_buildAttachmentItemPreview` was commented out, implying `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` might have been rendered directly in `buildField` for a short period.
    *   **BLoC event pause (10/15/2025, 3:11:44 PM):** The logic for dispatching `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentAdded` to the `ItilFormAttachmentBloc` in `_addMultipleAttachments` was commented out, effectively pausing BLoC integration for new attachments from this file.
    *   **BLoC Event Re-activation and Refinement (10/15/2025, 3:33:05 PM):** The `_buildAttachmentItemPreview` was restored. The commented-out BLoC logic in `_addMultipleAttachments` was uncommented and modified to dispatch a *list* of `FormAttachmentFieldTypeItilAttachment` objects, suggesting a refined approach to handling multiple new attachments for upload. The `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` inside `_buildAttachmentItemPreview` no longer handles its own loading state.
    *   **Minor Additions (10/15/2025, 3:41:14 PM):** An unused `List<int> ids;` property was added to the class.
    *   **Typo/Incomplete change (10/15/2025, 3:49:22 PM):** An `onchanged()` call (likely a typo for `onChanged(updatedModel)`) was added within the bloc stream listener in `_addMultipleAttachments`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/data/model/attachment/attachment_local_file.dart`**
    *   **New Property (10/15/2025, 3:26:55 PM):** A `UCResult? result` property was added to the `AttachmentLocalFile` data model, likely to store the upload outcome for each attachment.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/fields/form_attachment_field_ui_model.dart`**
    *   **New Property (10/15/2025, 3:29:26 PM):** A `Map<AttachmentLocalFile, UCResult?> map` property was added to track the upload status or result associated with each local attachment file within the UI model.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/itil_form_attachment_bloc.dart`**
    *   **Core Logic (10/15/2025, 3:31:25 PM):** This BLoC handles the actual upload of attachments using `UploadFileToItilUseCase`. It iterates through a list of `FormAttachmentFieldTypeItilAttachment` and calls the use case for each.
    *   **Work-in-progress (10/15/2025, 3:31:35 PM - 3:32:56 PM):** Several entries show commented-out `emit` calls and incomplete code like `map;` and `emit();`, indicating ongoing development or debugging of state emission logic within the `uploadAttachment` method.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/fields/itil_attachment_field_ui_model.dart`**
    *   **Initial Structure (10/15/2025, 3:50:29 PM):** Defines `attachments` and `map` to hold upload results.
    *   **Rapid Refactoring/Renaming (10/15/2025, 3:50:42 PM - 3:55:19 PM):** This file underwent a series of rapid changes:
        *   Briefly lost `map` in constructor, then restored it.
        *   Introduced a comment about making the class generic.
        *   Was made generic (`<T>`), then had the generic type removed.
        *   Changed class names multiple times: `ItilAttachmentFieldUIModel` -> `FormAttachmentFieldUIModel` -> `AttachmentFieldUIModel` -> `AttachmentFieldUIModelWithRes` -> `FormAttachmentFieldUIModelWithResult`.
        *   The constructor name was inconsistent with the class name for several entries before finally being harmonized at `FormAttachmentFieldUIModelWithResult`. The comment about renaming to something generic remained even after the class was renamed to `FormAttachmentFieldUIModelWithResult`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/15/2025, 3:04:52 PM:** Major simplification of `AttachmentItemPreview`, moving BLoC responsibilities upwards.
*   **10/15/2025, 3:10:11 PM:** `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` takes on BLoC responsibilities, initiating uploads and handling individual attachment loading states.
*   **10/15/2025, 3:26:55 PM & 3:29:26 PM:** Data models (`AttachmentLocalFile`, `FormAttachmentFieldUIModel`) are updated to include fields for tracking upload results (`UCResult?`).
*   **10/15/2025, 3:33:05 PM:** `FSFormItemAttachmentField` re-activates and refines its BLoC event dispatching for new attachments, now sending a list of attachments.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Flutter Bloc for State Management:** The most prominent pattern is the extensive use of `flutter_bloc` (`ItilFormAttachmentBloc`, `BlocProvider`, `BlocBuilder`, `Emitter`) for managing the state of attachment uploads and displaying appropriate UI feedback (loading, error, success).
*   **Attachment Lifecycle:** The changes depict an evolving understanding of the attachment lifecycle, from selecting files to uploading them and displaying their status within the UI.
*   **UI/BLoC Responsibility Shifts:** There's a clear pattern of shifting BLoC integration responsibilities between widgets (`AttachmentItemPreview` -> `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` -> `FSFormItemAttachmentField`) to find the optimal place for state management and UI updates.
*   **Logging:** `fs_logger` is consistently used across multiple files (`AttachmentItemPreviewRoot`, `FSFormItemAttachmentField`, `ItilFormAttachmentBloc`) to log events, states, and debug information.
*   **`UCResult` Integration:** The `UCResult` type from `common_business` and `core` is used to represent the outcome of use cases (like file uploads), indicating a standardized approach to handling results from business logic.
*   **Iterative Development:** The rapid sequence of changes, especially the renaming and partial modifications, suggests an iterative and agile development process with frequent commits. "fixme" comments also highlight areas of ongoing work.

## 4:57:44 PM
The code changes primarily focus on refactoring and enhancing attachment handling within a Flutter application, specifically around form fields and a BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for managing attachment uploads. Key updates and patterns include:

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/fields/itil_attachment_field_ui_model.dart`**:
    *   Initially defined `FormAttachmentWithUploadResult`.
    *   **10/15/2025, 3:58:57 PM**: Renamed the constructor to match the class name (`FormAttachmentWithUploadResult`).
    *   This file appears to be replaced or superseded later by `form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model.dart`.
*   **`/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/fields/form_attachment_field_ui_model.dart`**:
    *   **10/15/2025, 3:59:22 PM**: Established `FormAttachmentFieldUIModel` extending `FormFieldUIModel`, defining core properties for attachment fields like `attachments`, `attachmentExtensionConfig`, `noOfAttachmentsAllowed`, and implementing `copyWith`, `==`, `hashCode`, `toString` methods.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:17:49 PM**: Briefly introduced `uploadResultMap` directly into `FormAttachmentFieldUIModel`.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:17:57 PM**: Reverted the addition of `uploadResultMap`, indicating a decision to keep upload result state separate from the primary attachment field model.
*   **`/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/fields/form_attachment_with_upload_result.dart`**:
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:02:03 PM**: The `FormAttachmentWithUploadResult` class was renamed to `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`.
*   **`/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/fields/form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model.dart`**:
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:02:17 PM**: This new file was introduced (likely due to the previous rename), defining `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` to hold a list of `AttachmentLocalFile` and a `Map` for upload results.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:05:51 PM**: Minor formatting change to the constructor.
*   **`/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/model/form_attachment_field_type.dart`**:
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:00:21 PM**: Introduced `sealed class FormAttachmentFieldType` with `FormAttachmentFieldTypeAttachment` and `FormAttachmentFieldTypeItilAttachment`. The latter held `itilAttachmentFieldUIModel`.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:00:37 PM**: Renamed `itilAttachmentFieldUIModel` property to `formAttachmentWithUploadResult` within `FormAttachmentFieldTypeItilAttachment`.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Removed an unused import.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:08:15 PM**: Updated import to `form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model.dart` and renamed the property again to `formAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`.
*   **`/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/model/fs_form_attachment_event.dart`**:
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:06:58 PM**: Introduced generics (`<AttachmentType extends FormAttachmentFieldType>`) to `FSFormAttachmentEvent` and its subclasses for `OnAttachmentAdded`, `OnAttachmentRemoved`, and `OnRetry`.
*   **`/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/model/fs_form_attachment_state.dart`**:
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:32:09 PM**: Defined `sealed class FSFormAttachmentState` with `Initial`, `Loading`, `UploadSuccess`, and `Error` states.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:35:16 PM**: Added `file` parameter to `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading`.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:40:30 PM - 4:40:56 PM**: Refactored `file` and `attachment` types within `Loading`, `UploadSuccess`, and `Error` states to handle lists and maps of attachments and results.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:43:21 PM - 4:43:42 PM**: Refactored `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadSuccess` to use a `resultMap` (`Map<AttachmentLocalFile, ItilAttachment>`) to store upload outcomes.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:50:26 PM - 4:50:55 PM**: Temporarily broke and then restored the state classes, refining `UploadSuccess` `resultMap` to store `UCResult<ItilAttachment>`.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:51:13 PM**: Renamed `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadSuccess` to `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted`, reflecting a state where an upload process has occurred, not necessarily all successfully.
*   **`/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/fs_form_base_attachment_bloc.dart`**:
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:11:24 PM**: Introduced the abstract `FSFormBaseAttachmentBloc` with generic `AttachmentType` and event handlers for `OnAttachmentAdded`, `OnAttachmentRemoved`, and `OnRetry`.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:11:49 PM**: Simplified `uploadAttachment` and `retryUploadAttachment` signatures to take `AttachmentType` directly.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:35:25 PM - 4:36:35 PM**: Temporarily changed the BLoC state to `List<FSFormAttachmentState>` but reverted this decision shortly after.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:44:28 PM - 4:45:13 PM**: Changed `uploadAttachment` and `retryUploadAttachment` return types from `Future<List<UCResult>>` to `Future<void>`, indicating that state emission, not method return, is the primary way of signaling outcomes.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:53:36 PM**: Commented out the `on<FSFormAttachmentEventOnRetry>` event handler, suggesting a temporary disablement or ongoing refactoring of retry logic.
*   **`/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/itil_form_attachment_bloc.dart`**:
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:18:28 PM**: Started implementing `ItilFormAttachmentBloc` extending `FSFormBaseAttachmentBloc`, introducing `UploadFileToItilUseCase`. The `uploadAttachment` method went through many iterations to correctly extract `attachments` from `itilAttachments` (casting `FormAttachmentFieldType` to `FormAttachmentFieldTypeItilAttachment` and then accessing `formAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel.attachments`).
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:31:44 PM**: Started emitting `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading` at the beginning of the `uploadAttachment` process.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:46:16 PM - 4:49:16 PM**: Implemented logic to process individual attachment upload results (`UCResult<ItilAttachment>`) and build a `resultsMap` (`Map<AttachmentLocalFile, UCResult<ItilAttachment>>`). The loop correctly populates this map.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:51:45 PM**: Emitted `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted` with the `resultsMap` after all uploads are processed, and added `return;`.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:52:18 PM - 4:52:42 PM**: Added detailed `FSLogger` statements to trace attachment upload activity.
*   **`/common_business/lib/src/data/model/attachment/attachment_local_file.dart`**:
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:19:13 PM**: Defined `AttachmentLocalFile` using the `freezed` package, encapsulating local file details including the `XFile`.
*   **`/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`**:
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:01:34 PM**: The `FSFormItemAttachmentField` widget was set up, handling UI for attachment picking, displaying previews, and removing attachments. It uses a `BlocProvider` and `BlocBuilder` for `ItilFormAttachmentBloc`.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:01:42 PM - 4:10:57 PM**: Iteratively updated the `_addMultipleAttachments` method to correctly construct `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentAdded` events, passing the `newAttachments` and an initialized `uploadResultMap` within `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`. This involved multiple corrections to parameter names and types.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:17:08 PM**: Briefly attempted to change `FSFormItemAttachmentField` to extend `FSFormBaseField<FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel>`.
    *   **10/15/2025, 4:17:25 PM**: Quickly reverted the type back to `FSFormBaseField<FormAttachmentFieldUIModel>`, confirming the separation of the primary field model from its upload result state.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **10/15/2025, 3:58 PM - 4:02 PM**: Initial setup and early refactoring of core attachment models (`itil_attachment_field_ui_model.dart`, `form_attachment_with_upload_result.dart`) and the introduction of `FormAttachmentFieldType`.
*   **10/15/2025, 4:06 PM - 4:10 PM**: Introduction of generics in BLoC events and significant, iterative refinement of how attachment events are constructed and passed in `fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`, particularly concerning the `uploadResultMap`.
*   **10/15/2025, 4:17 PM**: A brief, but quickly reverted, attempt to integrate `uploadResultMap` directly into `FormAttachmentFieldUIModel`, indicating design consideration and a rapid decision to keep it separate.
*   **10/15/2025, 4:32 PM - 4:43 PM**: Major changes to `fs_form_attachment_state.dart` and `itil_form_attachment_bloc.dart` to manage complex upload states, including loading for multiple files and mapping individual file upload results.
*   **10/15/2025, 4:51 PM**: Renaming `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadSuccess` to `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted` and finalization of the `uploadAttachment` logic in `ItilFormAttachmentBloc`, completing the flow for handling a batch of uploads.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Iterative Refinement**: Many files show multiple commits within minutes, indicating rapid development cycles, trial-and-error, and immediate corrections, especially regarding type safety, parameter names, and object instantiation.
*   **BLoC Architecture**: A strong reliance on Flutter BLoC for state management, with `Bloc`s, `Event`s, and `State`s being central to the attachment feature.
*   **Type Safety and Generics**: Frequent use of explicit type casting (`as`) and generics to ensure type safety, although sometimes leading to temporary compile errors or incorrect logic in early iterations.
*   **Logging**: `FSLogger.logWithTag` is extensively used for debugging and tracing the flow of events and states within the application.
*   **Attachment Upload Process**: The recurring theme is the implementation of a robust process for uploading multiple attachments, tracking their individual statuses (loading, success, error) using a map, and reflecting these states in the UI and BLoC.
*   **Naming Conventions**: Evolution of naming conventions (e.g., from `FormAttachmentWithUploadResult` to `...UIModel`) to better reflect the purpose or layer of the code.
*   **Unimplemented Error Handling**: `// TODO: Handle this case. throw UnimplementedError();` comments indicate that comprehensive error handling for individual upload results is planned but not yet fully implemented.
*   **Commented-out Code**: Several sections of code are commented out, suggesting alternative approaches or debugging efforts during development.

## 5:57:09 PM
The provided log details changes across two Dart files, primarily focusing on attachment handling within a Freshservice Flutter application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile\_flutter\_freshservice/libraries/fs\_lib/form\_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs\_form\_item\_attachment\_field.dart**
    *   **Initial State (10/15/2025, 5:02:21 PM):** The `FSFormItemAttachmentField` class handles attachment selection, addition, and removal. It uses a BLoC (ItilFormAttachmentBloc) to manage attachment upload states, subscribing to its stream to log `UploadAttempted` and `Error` states, with a 30-second timeout for subscription cancellation.
    *   **Minor Logging & State Changes (10/15/2025, 5:02:29 PM - 5:02:49 PM):** Small adjustments were made to the logging messages and the specific BLoC state being handled in the stream listener. `FSFormAttachmentStateError` was changed to `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading` for stream processing, and corresponding log messages were refined.
    *   **Subscription Logic Fluctuation (10/15/2025, 5:16:38 PM - 5:18:54 PM):** There were several rapid changes related to how the BLoC stream `subscription` was managed:
        *   **Potential Bug Introduction (5:16:38 PM):** The stream subscription was temporarily moved inside a `Future.delayed` block, making it ineffective for immediate state listening.
        *   **Reversion & Refinement (5:16:48 PM - 5:17:26 PM):** This was quickly reverted, re-establishing the immediate subscription and adding `dart:async` import, along with minor variable declaration style changes.
        *   **Immediate Cancellation Intent (5:17:50 PM):** The subscription was modified to cancel itself immediately upon receiving either an `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted` or `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading` state, with the 30-second `Future.delayed` becoming a fallback.
        *   **Brief Reversion (5:18:54 PM):** The immediate cancellation logic was briefly removed.
        *   **Re-introduction of Immediate Cancellation with Fallback (5:19:55 PM):** The immediate cancellation logic was re-added, explicitly stating the 30-second delay as a fallback mechanism.
    *   **Null Safety & Debug Logging (10/15/2025, 5:20:20 PM - 5:24:54 PM):** The `StreamSubscription` was made nullable (`StreamSubscription<...>?`) with safe calls (`?.cancel()`), and debug logs were added to track the subscription status more effectively.
    *   **Generic Type Update (10/15/2025, 5:29:20 PM):** The generic type of `FSFormItemAttachmentField` was updated from `FSFormBaseField<FormAttachmentFieldUIModel>` to `FSFormBaseField<FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel>`, indicating a specialization or refactoring of the UI model being used.
    *   **Model Property Updates in BLoC Event (10/15/2025, 5:36:37 PM - 5:55:46 PM):** Changes were made in `_addMultipleAttachments` within the `bloc.add` call. The `FormAttachmentFieldTypeItilAttachment` event was updated to use `model.copyWith()` to pass new `attachments` and `uploadResultMap`, ensuring the BLoC receives an updated model reflecting the new attachments. There were also further attempts to update the `onChanged` callback directly within the BLoC stream listener, specifically trying to update `attachments` based on `state.resultMap.keys.toList()` when `state is FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted` (5:50:19 PM - 5:50:48 PM), which was then removed.

2.  **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile\_flutter\_freshservice/libraries/fs\_lib/form\_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/fields/form\_attachment\_with\_upload\_result\_ui\_model.dart**
    *   **Initial Definition (10/15/2025, 5:27:04 PM):** This new UI model, extending `FormAttachmentFieldUIModel`, was introduced to include `uploadResultMap`.
    *   **Constructor Refinements (10/15/2025, 5:27:15 PM - 5:28:11 PM):** The constructor was iteratively updated to correctly initialize parameters by forwarding them to the superclass constructor using `required super.` or by explicitly defining default values (`super.isVisible = true`, `super.attachments = const []`). This rectified an initial omission where superclass parameters were not properly passed.
    *   **Temporary `toString()` (10/15/2025, 5:28:51 PM - 5:29:10 PM):** A `toString()` method was briefly added for debugging purposes and then removed.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/15/2025, 5:16:38 PM:** Temporary but significant (bug-introducing) change to BLoC subscription logic.
*   **10/15/2025, 5:16:48 PM:** Reversion of the BLoC subscription bug.
*   **10/15/2025, 5:17:50 PM:** Introduction of immediate subscription cancellation within the listener callback.
*   **10/15/2025, 5:19:55 PM:** Re-introduction and clarification of immediate subscription cancellation with a fallback timeout.
*   **10/15/2025, 5:27:04 PM:** Introduction of `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`.
*   **10/15/2025, 5:27:42 PM - 5:28:11 PM:** Iterative correction and refinement of `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`'s constructor.
*   **10/15/2025, 5:29:20 PM:** Update of the generic type in `fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart` to use the newly refined `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`.
*   **10/15/2025, 5:36:37 PM onwards:** Refinements to how the `copyWith` method of the model is used when dispatching BLoC events, indicating a focus on state immutability and proper data flow.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **BLoC Stream Management:** A strong recurring pattern is the iteration and refinement of how BLoC stream subscriptions are handled in `_addMultipleAttachments`. This involves when to cancel the subscription (immediately on first state or after a timeout) and what states to log. This suggests an active debugging or optimization effort around handling asynchronous attachment upload results.
*   **UI Model Evolution:** The `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` undergoes several quick changes, demonstrating the process of defining and correctly implementing new data models for the UI layer, particularly for fields with complex state like attachments undergoing an upload process.
*   **Logger Usage:** `FSLogger.logWithTag` is extensively used for debugging, especially within the BLoC stream listener, indicating a focus on understanding the flow of attachment upload states.
*   **Immutability with `copyWith`:** The use of `model.copyWith(attachments: updatedAttachments)` consistently when updating the `updatedModel` reflects a pattern of working with immutable UI models, a common practice in Flutter BLoC architectures.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The numerous changes within a short time span (minutes) indicate rapid development, experimentation, and debugging cycles.

## 6:56:58 PM
The code changes primarily focus on enhancing the attachment functionality within the Freshservice mobile application, specifically concerning the handling and display of attachment upload statuses. The updates span across three files: a form field for attachments, a root widget for displaying attachment previews, and an individual attachment preview item widget. The changes occurred rapidly, often seconds apart, between 5:57 PM and 6:10 PM on October 15, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`**
    *   **Initial Refinement (10/15/2025, 5:58:16 PM - 5:58:24 PM):** The `_addMultipleAttachments` method was modified to correctly manage the `uploadResultMap`. Instead of creating a new map for each batch of new attachments, it now updates the existing `model.uploadResultMap`. The way this map is passed to the `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentAdded` event was also adjusted.
    *   **State Handling Improvement (10/15/2025, 5:59:02 PM):** The `onChanged(updatedModel)` callback was added within the `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading` block, ensuring that the UI model is updated even during the loading phase of an attachment upload.
    *   **Integration with Preview Root (10/15/2025, 6:09:23 PM - 6:09:33 PM):** The `_buildAttachmentItemPreview` widget was updated to pass the `model.uploadResultMap` to the `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` widget, allowing the preview component to display the upload status.

2.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/attachment/attachment_item_preview_root.dart`**
    *   **Type Refinement and Import (10/15/2025, 5:59:53 PM - 6:00:18 PM):** The generic type for `attachmentUploadResults` was corrected from `<>` to `<ItilAttachment>`. An import for `package:core/core.dart` was added.
    *   **Constructor Update (10/15/2025, 6:00:29 PM):** The constructor was updated to require `attachmentUploadResults` as a parameter.
    *   **Passing Upload Results to Children (10/15/2025, 6:08:38 PM - 6:08:57 PM):** The `_buildAttachmentsList` method was modified to pass the specific `uploadResult` for each attachment to its corresponding `AttachmentItemPreview` widget.
    *   **Nullable Upload Results (10/15/2025, 6:10:19 PM):** The `attachmentUploadResults` map type was updated to allow for nullable `UCResult<ItilAttachment>` values, indicating that an upload result might not yet be available (e.g., pending upload).

3.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/fields/form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model.dart`**
    *   **Type Correction (10/15/2025, 6:00:44 PM):** The `copyWith` method's `uploadResultMap` parameter type was updated to explicitly include `<ItilAttachment>` in `UCResult`, aligning with the more precise typing used elsewhere.

4.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/attachment/attachment_item_preview.dart`**
    *   **Adding Upload Result Parameter (10/15/2025, 6:01:10 PM - 6:01:32 PM):** A new `uploadResult` parameter of type `UCResult<ItilAttachment>?` was added to the `AttachmentItemPreview` widget's fields and constructor.
    *   **Dynamic Trailing Widget (10/15/2025, 6:02:18 PM - 6:05:59 PM):** The `trailing` widget of the `FSListTile` was refactored into a `_buildTrailing` method. This method now dynamically displays a loading spinner for pending uploads, a close icon for successful uploads, or a retry icon for failed uploads, based on the `uploadResult`.
    *   **Enhanced Status Indicators (10/15/2025, 6:07:58 PM - 6:08:24 PM):** The `_buildTrailing` method was further refined. For loading states, it now shows both a loading spinner and a close icon. For error states, it shows both a retry icon and a close icon, arranged in a `Row` with spacing. Minor formatting adjustments were also made.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Attachment Upload State Management**: A strong focus on visually representing the lifecycle of an attachment upload (loading, success, error) to the user.
*   **BLoC Pattern Integration**: `fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart` leverages BLoC for reactive state management, subscribing to `FSFormAttachmentState` changes to update the UI model (`FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`).
*   **`UCResult<ItilAttachment>`**: This generic result type is consistently used across components to communicate the outcome of asynchronous operations, specifically the attachment upload process, allowing for handling of success and error scenarios.
*   **UI Component Collaboration**: Changes show a clear pattern of data flow and collaboration between `FSFormItemAttachmentField` (the form field), `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` (the data model), `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` (the list container), and `AttachmentItemPreview` (individual item display) to propagate and reflect upload statuses.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: The timestamps indicate a concentrated period of development, likely involving quick successive changes to implement and refine the attachment upload status display.
