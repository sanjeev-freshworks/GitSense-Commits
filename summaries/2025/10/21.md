# Activity Summary for 10/21/2025

## 10:34:43 AM
The provided log details a series of rapid updates to a single file:
`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/validator/impl/form_item_attachment_field_validator.dart`

The core functionality of the `FormAttachmentFieldValidator` class, which is to validate attachment fields, remained consistent across all changes. It checks for two primary conditions:
1.  Whether a required, editable, and visible attachment field is empty.
2.  Whether the number of attachments exceeds the `noOfAttachmentsAllowed` limit.

The significant changes, all occurring within a minute between 10:31:56 AM and 10:32:35 AM on 10/21/2025, involve the generic type parameter used by the `FormAttachmentFieldValidator` class and its `validate` method. This indicates an evolution in the specific UI model object the validator is designed to process:
*   **10/21/2025, 10:31:56 AM:** The validator was initially parameterized with `FormAttachmentFieldUIModel`.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:32:08 AM:** This was updated to `FormItemAttachmentFieldUIModel`, suggesting a refinement or renaming of the UI model.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:32:35 AM:** The type was further changed to `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`, implying a more specific UI model that likely incorporates information about upload results, indicating a deeper integration or refactoring of attachment handling logic.

The close timestamps suggest a focused and rapid iteration, likely refactoring or adjusting the type system for attachment UI models within the `form_lib` library.
