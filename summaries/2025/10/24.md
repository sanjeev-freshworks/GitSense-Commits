# Activity Summary for 10/24/2025

## 9:04:20 AM
The changes log a series of updates on 10/24/2025, primarily between 8:41 AM and 8:48 AM, focusing on enhancing attachment upload functionality and state management within the Freshservice mobile application's Flutter libraries.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/data/model/attachment/attachment_upload_state.dart` (8:41:33 AM):**
    *   Introduced a `sealed class` `AttachmentUploadState` with distinct subclasses: `AttachmentUploadStateInitial`, `AttachmentUploadStateInProgress`, `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess`, and `AttachmentUploadStateError`.
    *   `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` was defined to hold an `attachmentId` (an integer).
*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/fields/form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model.dart` (8:42:33 AM):**
    *   The `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` class was updated to include a `Map<AttachmentLocalFile, AttachmentUploadState> uploadResultMap` to track the state of individual attachments.
    *   Its `copyWith`, `operator ==`, `hashCode`, and `copyValueFrom` methods were modified to incorporate this new map.
    *   The `getDomainModels` method was updated to extract `attachmentId` values only from attachments that are in an `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` state.
*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/form_attachment_upload_bloc.dart` (8:43:05 AM and 8:43:40 AM):**
    *   The `uploadAttachment` method in `FormAttachmentUploadBloc` was refined. Initially, it passed the `ItilAttachment` object (`value`) directly to `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` (8:43:05 AM).
    *   A subsequent correction (8:43:40 AM) changed this to correctly extract the `id` property from the `ItilAttachment` object (`value.id`) when creating `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess`, aligning it with the `attachmentId` constructor parameter.
    *   Logging was added to trace the upload process and attachment removal events.
*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/test/ui/bloc/form_attachment_upload_bloc_test.dart` (8:44:05 AM):**
    *   This file received extensive updates to unit tests for the `FormAttachmentUploadBloc`.
    *   `setUpAll` was added to provide dummy data for `UCResult<ItilAttachment>`, `AttachmentLocalFile`, and `ItilAttachment`.
    *   New `blocTest` cases were introduced to verify:
        *   Single and multiple attachment uploads (success and failure) when `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentAdded` is triggered.
        *   Attachment removal scenarios when `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentRemoved` is triggered.
        *   Retry logic for both successful and failed uploads when `FSFormAttachmentEventOnRetry` is triggered.
    *   Test expectations for `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` were updated to assert against `attachmentId` (an integer).
*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/test/ui/fields/model/fields/form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model_test.dart` (Multiple entries: 8:45:32 AM, 8:45:40 AM, 8:45:54 AM, 8:46:08 AM, 8:46:17 AM, 8:46:27 AM, 8:46:35 AM):**
    *   These rapid updates to the same test file corrected the test fixtures for `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`.
    *   Specifically, `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` instances in `copyValueFrom`, `getDomainModels`, and `equality` tests were updated to use `attachmentId: [int]` instead of `attachment: ItilAttachment(...)`, ensuring consistency with the `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` constructor.
*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/test/ui/fields/presentation/validator/impl/helper/form_item_attachment_field_validator_expected_io.dart` (8:46:52 AM and 8:48:34 AM):**
    *   Test fixtures within this file, particularly `_validCaseWithSuccessfulUploads`, were updated.
    *   `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` instantiations were corrected to use `attachmentId: [int]` instead of providing a full `ItilAttachment` object, aligning with the model definition.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/24/2025, 8:41:33 AM:** Definition of the core `AttachmentUploadState` sealed class.
*   **10/24/2025, 8:42:33 AM:** Integration of `AttachmentUploadState` into the UI model.
*   **10/24/2025, 8:43:40 AM:** Critical fix in the BLoC to correctly extract `attachmentId` from `ItilAttachment`.
*   **10/24/2025, 8:44:05 AM:** Major update to `form_attachment_upload_bloc_test.dart`, adding comprehensive test cases.
*   **10/24/2025, 8:45:32 AM - 8:46:35 AM:** A series of rapid, iterative corrections in `form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model_test.dart` to fix test data consistency.
*   **10/24/2025, 8:46:52 AM - 8:48:34 AM:** Further corrections in `form_item_attachment_field_validator_expected_io.dart` to maintain test data consistency.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Attachment Upload State Management:** The overarching theme is the introduction and robust implementation of state management for attachment uploads, moving from a simpler model to one that tracks explicit states (initial, in progress, success, error).
*   **Focus on `attachmentId`:** The `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` is consistently defined and used to store only the `attachmentId` (an integer), rather than a full `ItilAttachment` object, simplifying the state. This is reflected across the model, BLoC, and tests.
*   **Iterative Test Refinement:** There's a clear pattern of initial implementation followed by a series of rapid, granular updates to test files. These corrections primarily ensure that test fixtures and expectations match the exact constructor signature of `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` and the revised business logic. This suggests a thorough testing approach and attention to detail during development.
*   **Tight Development Window:** All changes occurred within a relatively short period on the same day, indicating focused development activity on this specific feature.

## 10:04:35 AM
The code changes primarily revolve around the `form_lib` and `journey_lib` Flutter packages, focusing on the handling, validation, and upload of attachment fields within forms.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/test/ui/fields/presentation/validator/impl/helper/form_item_attachment_field_validator_expected_io.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 9:15:09 AM:** The test helper for attachment field validation was updated. Specifically, in the `_invalidCaseExceedsAttachmentLimit` test, the way `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` objects were created for mock successful uploads was simplified, switching from using `ItilAttachmentFixture.generateWithCustomId(id)` for the `attachment` property to directly setting the `attachmentId`.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 9:20:43 AM - 9:20:49 AM:** Several `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` instances across various test cases (`_validCaseWithSuccessfulUploads`, `_validCaseAttachmentsWithinLimit`, `_invalidCaseExceedsAttachmentLimit`) were updated to use the `const` keyword, indicating a move towards compile-time constants and immutability for these states. A brief inconsistency where one instance initially lost `const` was quickly corrected.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/form_itil_attachment_upload_bloc.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 9:31:10 AM:** The `FormAttachmentUploadBloc` class was renamed to `FormItilAttachmentUploadBloc`, suggesting a more specific scope for ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) attachment handling.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 9:38:24 AM:** The `uploadAttachment` method underwent a significant refactoring to enable **parallel execution** of attachment uploads. Instead of processing attachments sequentially, it was changed to collect all upload operations as `Future`s and then use `Future.wait` to await their completion concurrently, aiming to improve performance. Logging was updated to reflect this change.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 9:48:22 AM - 9:50:13 AM:** This period shows a complex series of changes and reversions within the `uploadAttachment` method. The parallel upload logic was reverted to a sequential approach. Several attempts were made to correctly handle asynchronous `UCResult<ItilAttachment>` values returned by `_uploadFileToItilUseCase` and map them to `AttachmentUploadState`. These changes involved introducing and removing `await` keywords, and attempting to use `Future.wait` with `.then` blocks, leading to intermediate states with potential syntax or logical errors, such as passing `Future` objects directly where concrete `AttachmentUploadState` was expected. The final state in this window appears to still struggle with consistently resolving futures before emitting states or storing results.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/fields/form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 9:52:03 AM - 9:53:56 AM:** The constructor for `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` was refined. Initially, it had an incomplete initialization for `uploadResultMap`. This was then changed to automatically populate `uploadResultMap` with `AttachmentUploadStateInitial` for all existing attachments, but this prevented external provision of the map. Finally, the constructor was correctly updated to use an initializer list, allowing an optional `uploadResultMap` parameter while still defaulting to `AttachmentUploadStateInitial` for attachments if no map is provided.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/activity_form/journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 9:59:11 AM - 10:02:03 AM:** The `_buildAttachmentField` method, responsible for rendering attachment input, underwent several rapid debugging-related changes. These involved attempts to log and access an `uploadResultMap` property from the `attachmentField` model. Initially, `uploadResultMap` was not accessible due to the model being cast as `FormAttachmentFieldUIModel` (which doesn't contain this map). Logging statements were repeatedly modified with incorrect property accesses (`model.upload`, `atta.uploadResultMap`, `attachmentField.upl`) before eventually settling on `attachmentField.uploadResultMap`, despite the type incompatibility. The commented-out code suggests an earlier, more robust attempt at handling `uploadResultMap` dynamically.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 10:03:32 AM:** The `switch` statement in the `build` method was updated to specifically recognize and handle `FormAttachmentFieldWithUploadResultUIModel` (likely a minor typo for `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`). However, the `_buildAttachmentField` method's internal logic for casting and accessing `uploadResultMap` continued to exhibit type inconsistencies with the base `FormAttachmentFieldUIModel`, indicating an incomplete integration of the new model structure.

**Patterns and recurring elements:**

*   **Attachment Uploads and Validation:** A consistent focus on the entire lifecycle of attachments in forms, from their initial state, through upload (success, in progress, error), to their validation and representation in UI models.
*   **Asynchronous Programming Challenges:** The `form_itil_attachment_upload_bloc.dart` file highlights common challenges in Flutter/Dart with managing `Future`s, especially when refactoring for concurrency and emitting state updates. The back-and-forth changes suggest a debugging and refinement process.
*   **UI Model Refinement:** The introduction and subsequent refinement of `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` indicates an evolution in how attachment data and their upload states are encapsulated and passed around the UI layer.
*   **Integration Gaps:** The `journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart` file illustrates the complexities of integrating new data models into existing UI components, specifically showing issues with type compatibility and correctly accessing new properties (`uploadResultMap`) during the transition.
*   **Immutability:** The use of `const` in test fixtures points to a practice of promoting immutability for better performance and predictability of state.

## 11:04:17 AM
The logs detail changes across two Flutter files related to form and attachment handling within the Freshservice mobile application, focusing on a "journey" context and ITIL attachments.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/activity_form/journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart`**

*   **Changes & Timestamps:**
    *   **10/24/2025, 10:05:12 AM - 10:05:20 AM:** An attempt was made to explicitly construct a `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` for the `FSFormItemAttachmentField` widget, using a previously commented-out `uploadResultMap` logic. This suggested an intent to pass detailed upload state information to the attachment field UI.
    *   **10/24/2025, 10:09:16 AM - 10:09:47 AM:** There were several rapid reversions and minor, possibly erroneous, re-attempts (e.g., `model: model as`) to define the `model` for `FSFormItemAttachmentField`. Throughout these changes, the `uploadResultMap` logic remained commented out or was not correctly integrated.
    *   **10/24/2025, 10:09:57 AM:** The commented-out code block related to `uploadResultMap` initialization was entirely removed, and the `model` parameter for `FSFormItemAttachmentField` was settled to directly use `attachmentField`. This indicates a simplification or delegation of the upload result mapping responsibility away from this specific UI component.
*   **Key Updates:** The `_buildAttachmentField` method, responsible for rendering attachment input fields, underwent iterative modifications. The main theme was figuring out how to pass and manage attachment upload states (`uploadResultMap`) to the UI component. Ultimately, the complex logic for preparing `uploadResultMap` was removed from this file, suggesting that the `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` itself or an upstream process is now expected to provide this information.
*   **Significance:** These changes streamlined the UI component by removing local state management for attachment upload results, likely shifting this responsibility to a higher-level BLoC or UI model.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/form_itil_attachment_upload_bloc.dart`**

*   **Changes & Timestamps:**
    *   **10/24/2025, 10:19:28 AM - 10:23:56 AM:** This period shows a series of rapid and often incorrect attempts to manage asynchronous attachment uploads. The primary challenge was correctly handling `Future` objects, specifically passing and resolving `AttachmentUploadState` within the `uploadAttachment` method. There were multiple instances of undefined variables (`uploadStates`), incorrect `Future` type specifications, and misuses of `Future.wait` or `await`. A brief correct usage of `await uploadState` at **10:22:20 AM** was quickly reverted. This indicates an active debugging phase to get the asynchronous logic right.
    *   **10/24/2025, 10:28:18 AM:** A significant refactor was implemented. The `uploadAttachment` method was changed from sequentially processing attachments to initiating parallel uploads using `Future.wait`. Each attachment's upload now resolves its `AttachmentUploadState` and immediately emits an `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted` event, providing real-time feedback for individual uploads. The entire process then awaits the completion of all parallel uploads.
    *   **10/24/2025, 10:32:16 AM:** No functional changes from the previous entry, confirming the refactored state.
*   **Key Updates:** The `uploadAttachment` method in `FormItilAttachmentUploadBloc` was completely overhauled. It transitioned from an inefficient, problematic sequential asynchronous upload strategy to a robust parallel upload mechanism. The `removeAttachment` method remained consistent throughout, updating the state to reflect removed files.
*   **Significance:** This major refactor improves the efficiency and user experience of uploading multiple ITIL attachments by allowing them to be processed concurrently and providing more granular progress updates.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Attachment Feature Development:** Both files are directly involved in the functionality of handling attachments within forms, suggesting ongoing development or refinement of this feature.
*   **Asynchronous Programming Challenges:** The `form_itil_attachment_upload_bloc.dart` log highlights the common difficulties in implementing complex asynchronous logic in Dart/Flutter, with many incremental fixes and corrections leading to a more robust solution.
*   **BLoC Pattern & State Management:** The use of `flutter_bloc` and `emit` calls indicates a BLoC architectural pattern for state management, which is central to how data and UI are synchronized.
*   **Logging for Debugging:** Both files make extensive use of `FSLogger.logWithTag`, suggesting that logging is a critical tool for understanding and debugging the application's flow, especially during the iterative development of complex features.
*   **UI/Logic Separation:** `journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart` focuses on UI rendering and interaction (`ValueChanged`, `GlobalKey`, `Scrollable.ensureVisible`), while `form_itil_attachment_upload_bloc.dart` manages business logic and state transitions (`UploadFileToItilUseCase`, `UCResult`, `AttachmentUploadState`). This separation of concerns is a consistent pattern.

## 12:04:18 PM
The logged changes primarily revolve around the introduction and refinement of an ITIL-specific attachment field within a Flutter application's form library.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`**: This file underwent rapid iterations between 10/24/2025, 11:26:25 AM and 11:27:16 AM. Initially, it used `FormItilAttachmentUploadBloc`. It then briefly switched to `FSFormBaseAttachmentBloc` (11:26:45 AM) and then `FormAttachmentUploadBloc` (11:27:08 AM) for its `BlocProvider`, `BlocBuilder`, and `context.read` calls, before reverting all these changes back to `FormItilAttachmentUploadBloc` at 11:27:16 AM. This suggests an exploratory or corrective phase regarding the specific BLoC to be utilized.
*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`**: Introduced at 10/24/2025, 11:27:30 AM, this file appears to be a specialized or renamed version. It consistently uses `FormItilAttachmentUploadBloc` for attachment handling. Its class name was changed from `FSFormItemAttachmentField` to `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` at 11:27:49 AM, with its internal `_tag` string updated to match this new name at 11:27:59 AM.
*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/form_itil_attachment_upload_bloc.dart`**: At 10/24/2025, 11:28:16 AM, this file details the `FormItilAttachmentUploadBloc`. It extends `FSFormBaseAttachmentBloc` and provides functionality for `uploadAttachment` (including parallel uploads and emitting state per file) and `removeAttachment` events for ITIL-specific attachments.
*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/test/ui/bloc/form_itil_attachment_upload_bloc_test.dart`**: This test file, updated at 10/24/2025, 11:28:51 AM, includes comprehensive unit tests for `FormItilAttachmentUploadBloc`. It covers successful and failed uploads (single and multiple), attachment removal, and retry mechanisms, ensuring the bloc's robustness.
*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/form/view/fields/form_attachment_field_item_catalog_screen.dart`**: This UI catalog entry was updated at 10/24/2025, 11:36:25 AM to display the attachment field. Initially, it referenced a non-existent `FSFormItilItemAttachmentField` class, which was corrected to `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` at 11:36:37 AM, aligning with the class rename in the form library.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/24/2025, 11:27:16 AM:** The `fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart` file settled on `FormItilAttachmentUploadBloc` after multiple Bloc type changes. This seems to be the precursor to the explicit ITIL specialization.
*   **10/24/2025, 11:27:49 AM - 11:27:59 AM:** The class `FSFormItemAttachmentField` was definitively renamed to `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` and its internal `_tag` updated in `fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`, marking a clear specialization.
*   **10/24/2025, 11:28:16 AM:** The implementation of the `FormItilAttachmentUploadBloc` shows how ITIL attachments are handled, including parallel uploads and specific state management.
*   **10/24/2025, 11:36:37 AM:** The UI catalog application was updated to reflect the new, specialized ITIL attachment field, indicating the component's readiness for display.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Specialization for ITIL:** The most prominent pattern is the shift from a generic "attachment field" to an "ITIL attachment field" (evident in file renames, class name changes, and specific BLoC usage). This suggests a targeted effort to implement or refine attachment handling tailored for ITIL workflows.
*   **Consistent BLoC Architecture:** The use of `BlocProvider`, `BlocBuilder`, and `context.read` for state management is consistently applied across the UI components interacting with attachment logic.
*   **Attachment Lifecycle Management:** The core functions for `_addMultipleAttachments`, `_removeAttachment`, and `_retryAttachmentUpload` are recurring, demonstrating a standardized approach to attachment interaction.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** `FSLogger.logWithTag` is used extensively for internal debugging and tracing, and `_showErrorAlert` provides a consistent user-facing error display mechanism.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The use of `fsDIComponent.get<BlocType>()` indicates a reliance on a dependency injection framework for providing BLoC instances.

## 1:04:15 PM
The changes primarily focus on a single file: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`. This file defines the `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` widget, responsible for handling ITIL attachment uploads in a Flutter application, heavily utilizing the BLoC pattern for state management.

Key updates and their timestamps:

*   **10/24/2025, 12:13:03 PM (Initial State):** The file established the `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` as a field for attachments. It uses `BlocProvider` and `Builder` to integrate `FormItilAttachmentUploadBloc`. The `_addMultipleAttachments` method directly subscribes to the BLoC stream (`bloc.stream.listen`) to react to attachment upload states. This method included logic to handle `AttachmentUploadStateInitial`, `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted`, `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading`, and `FSFormAttachmentStateRemoved` events, updating the `model` via `onChanged`. A `StreamSubscription` was declared but not explicitly managed for cancellation.
*   **10/24/2025, 12:13:11 PM:** A minor change occurred, removing the explicit `StreamSubscription` variable declaration. However, the `bloc.stream.listen` call remained, meaning an unmanaged subscription would still be created.
*   **10/24/2025, 12:13:17 PM:** Minor code cleanup, removing the unused `dart:async` import and some duplicate common imports. No functional changes.
*   **10/24/2025, 12:17:33 PM:** Within `_addMultipleAttachments`, attempts were made to improve state management by introducing `currentModel` and `latestModel` variables to ensure the stream listener operates on the most up-to-date state, mitigating potential issues with stale `model` references in asynchronous callbacks.
*   **10/24/2025, 12:18:04 PM (Major Refactoring):** The `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` was refactored. The core UI and state management logic were extracted into a new private `StatefulWidget` called `_AttachmentFieldContent` and its `_AttachmentFieldContentState`. The `BlocProvider` was moved to wrap this new `StatefulWidget`. State updates from the BLoC were then handled via a `BlocListener` in the `_AttachmentFieldContentState`, which correctly managed an internal `_currentModel` state using `initState` and `didUpdateWidget`. However, the `_addMultipleAttachments` method still contained the old `bloc.stream.listen` logic, creating redundancy.
*   **10/24/2025, 12:18:45 PM (Refactoring Corrections & Error):** The redundant `bloc.stream.listen` logic was *removed* from `_addMultipleAttachments` in `_AttachmentFieldContentState`, making the `BlocListener` the sole handler for BLoC state changes. Methods like `_buildAttachmentItemPreview`, `_showAttachmentPicker`, `_addMultipleAttachments`, `_removeAttachment`, and `_retryAttachmentUpload` were updated to correctly use the `_currentModel` from the `_AttachmentFieldContentState`. Crucially, this entry also introduced a copy-paste error, duplicating a complete set of the attachment handling methods (e.g., `_showAttachmentPicker`, `_addMultipleAttachments`) at the end of the file, outside the `_AttachmentFieldContentState` class.
*   **10/24/2025, 12:20:23 PM:** The duplicate methods introduced in the previous change were removed, cleaning up the file structure. The `dart:async` import was also removed again, as it was no longer needed after the direct `StreamSubscription` was removed from the refactored code.
*   **10/24/2025, 12:20:44 PM (Significant Revert):** This entry represents a substantial revert of the refactoring efforts. The `_AttachmentFieldContent` `StatefulWidget` and its state class were *removed*. The `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` reverted to its initial structure, using `BlocProvider` and `Builder`. The `_addMultipleAttachments` method *reintroduced* the direct `bloc.stream.listen` approach with a `StreamSubscription` and a mutable `uploadStateMap`, similar to the very first version, to manage attachment upload states. The `dart:async` import was consequently reintroduced. This change effectively undoes the move towards a more robust `StatefulWidget` and `BlocListener` pattern for managing the component's internal state.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Continuous Iteration on Attachment Upload:** All changes revolve around the `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` and its methods for adding, removing, and retrying attachments.
*   **BLoC Integration Challenges:** There's a recurring pattern of attempting to correctly integrate BLoC state updates into the widget tree, specifically in managing the `model` state across asynchronous operations. The evolution shows different strategies for addressing stale data references within stream listeners, culminating in a refactoring to a `StatefulWidget` with `BlocListener`, and then a complete revert to the earlier, more direct stream subscription approach.
*   **Logging:** Consistent use of `FSLogger.logWithTag` to trace method invocations and BLoC state changes.
*   **UI Components:** Repeated use of `FSPlainButton`, `FSImage`, `SizedBox`, `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot`, and `FSAlertDialog` for user interaction and feedback.

## 6:04:14 PM
The provided log details a series of iterative changes to a single file:
`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`

These changes occurred between **October 24, 2025, 5:29:59 PM** and **October 24, 2025, 6:02:39 PM**, indicating a concentrated period of development and refactoring.

Key changes and their timestamps:

*   **10/24/2025, 5:29:59 PM**: The file initially defines `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` as a `FSFormBaseField` (likely a `StatelessWidget` wrapper) that uses `BlocProvider` and `BlocBuilder` to manage attachment upload states with `FormItilAttachmentUploadBloc`. It includes methods for picking, adding, removing, and retrying attachments, handling BLoC state changes via a `StreamSubscription`.
*   **10/24/2025, 5:53:20 PM**: The `_buildAttachmentItemPreview` method was updated. The `BlocBuilder` wrapper around `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` was removed, making the preview component directly receive `attachments` and `attachmentUploadStatesMap` from the parent's `model`. This implies a shift in where the BLoC state is observed for the preview.
*   **10/24/2025, 5:57:29 PM**: The `BlocProvider` was completely removed from the `buildField` method. This suggests that the `FormItilAttachmentUploadBloc` is now expected to be provided higher up in the widget tree, or the widget will rely on a dependency injection mechanism to access it.
*   **10/24/2025, 5:57:40 PM**: A minor dependency change occurred, where `import 'package:core/core.dart';` was removed. This was later reverted.
*   **10/24/2025, 5:58:13 PM**: Significant refactoring in `_addMultipleAttachments`:
    *   The `FormItilAttachmentUploadBloc` instance is now obtained directly via `fsDIComponent.get`, moving from `context.read<Bloc>()` to a direct dependency injection approach.
    *   Lifecycle management for the `StreamSubscription` was improved by introducing a `cancelSubscription` utility function and logic to cancel the subscription when all new attachments are processed or an error occurs.
    *   The `onChanged(updatedModel)` call for immediate UI update after adding new attachments was explicitly moved to occur *before* dispatching the BLoC event.
*   **10/24/2025, 5:58:24 PM**: `_removeAttachment` and `_retryAttachmentUpload` methods were updated to align with the new dependency injection pattern, retrieving the BLoC using `fsDIComponent.get`. The previously removed `import 'package:core/core.dart';` was re-added.
*   **10/24/2025, 6:00:48 PM - 6:01:53 PM**: A series of changes primarily focused on adding detailed logging (`FSLogger.logWithTag`) at various points within `buildField`, `_buildAttachmentItemPreview`, and `_addMultipleAttachments` to track attachment counts, upload map sizes, and BLoC stream states for debugging.
*   **10/24/2025, 6:02:09 PM**: The `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` class underwent a major refactoring, converting from a `StatelessWidget` (via `FSFormBaseField`) to a `StatefulWidget`. This change introduced an internal `_FSFormItemItilAttachmentFieldState` to manage the `currentModel` and handle updates via `initState` and `didUpdateWidget`, providing more granular control over its internal state.
*   **10/24/2025, 6:02:29 PM & 6:02:39 PM**: `ValueKey` properties were added to the `Column` widget in `_buildFieldContent` and the `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` widget in `_buildAttachmentItemPreview`. These keys are dynamically generated based on attachment and upload map lengths, aimed at optimizing Flutter's widget tree reconciliation and improving UI performance during list changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Shift in BLoC Integration**: There's a clear progression from using `BlocProvider`/`BlocBuilder` for implicit BLoC access to directly retrieving the BLoC instance via a dependency injection container (`fsDIComponent.get`).
*   **Enhanced State Management**: The refactoring from a stateless to a stateful widget, along with explicit stream subscription management (`cancelSubscription`), indicates a focus on more robust and controlled state handling within the component.
*   **Debugging and Observability**: The repeated addition of `FSLogger.logWithTag` statements throughout the methods highlights an effort to improve the debuggability and understanding of the widget's lifecycle and data flow.
*   **UI Performance Optimization**: The introduction of `ValueKey` suggests an intention to optimize how Flutter rebuilds and re-renders elements within the attachment list, especially when attachments are added or removed.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: The timestamp sequence shows a rapid iteration, with minor adjustments and logging additions interleaved with more significant structural refactorings.

## 7:04:30 PM
The code change log primarily focuses on significant refactoring and evolution of attachment handling within the Freshservice mobile Flutter application, specifically related to ITIL forms. The changes span several files, indicating a systemic overhaul of how attachments are displayed, uploaded, and managed.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile\_flutter\_freshservice/libraries/fs\_lib/common\_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/attachment/attachment\_item\_preview\_root.dart** (Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 6:07:13 PM)
    *   This file introduces `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot`, a `StatelessWidget` responsible for rendering a list of attachments.
    *   It takes a list of `AttachmentLocalFile` objects and a map of their `AttachmentUploadState`s.
    *   Callbacks for `onAttachmentRemoved` and `onAttachmentRetry` are provided, indicating interactivity.
    *   Extensive logging (`FSLogger.logWithTag`) is used to track component lifecycle and data flow.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile\_flutter\_freshservice/libraries/fs\_lib/form\_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs\_form\_item\_itil\_attachment\_field.dart**
    *   **10/24/2025, 6:07:43 PM**: Initial implementation of `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField`, a form field for ITIL attachments. It integrates `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` for UI and contains methods like `_showAttachmentPicker`, `_addMultipleAttachments`, `_removeAttachment`, and `_retryAttachmentUpload`. This version directly interacts with `FormItilAttachmentUploadBloc` through dependency injection (`fsDIComponent.get`) and manages `StreamSubscription`s for upload states.
    *   **10/24/2025, 6:14:48 PM**: A significant architectural change occurs. The `buildField` method is wrapped in a `BlocProvider` and `Builder`, demonstrating a shift to standard `flutter_bloc` integration for state management. Attachment logic within `_addMultipleAttachments` is refined to use `context.read<FormItilAttachmentUploadBloc>()`.
    *   **10/24/2025, 6:46:53 PM**: The `BlocProvider` is removed from `buildField`, implying the bloc is now provided higher up in the widget tree. Attachment state management logic within `_addMultipleAttachments` is further consolidated for clarity.
    *   **10/24/2025, 6:47:55 PM - 10/24/2025, 6:48:04 PM**: Minor corrections to context usage in `onAttachmentRemoved` callback.
    *   **10/24/2025, 6:48:35 PM - 10/24/2025, 6:53:01 PM**: The most substantial change for this file. A new `FsAttachmentController` is introduced as a `late final _controller` instance. The core logic for `_addMultipleAttachments`, `_removeAttachment`, and `_retryAttachmentUpload` within `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` is progressively commented out or rewritten to delegate to this `_controller`. Specifically, `_addMultipleAttachments` is simplified to a single call to `_controller.uploadFile(newAttachments)`.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile\_flutter\_freshservice/libraries/fs\_lib/form\_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs\_attachment\_controller.dart**
    *   **10/24/2025, 6:15:19 PM**: `AttachmentFieldController` is created. It defines an interface for attachment operations (`uploadFile`, `retryUpload`, `removeAttachment`, `cancelUpload`, `dispose`) and relies on `FileUploadService` and callbacks for model updates.
    *   **10/24/2025, 6:15:33 PM - 10/24/2025, 6:17:24 PM**: Renamed `FileUploadService` to `UploadFileToItilUseCase` and adjusted imports. The `uploadFile` parameter type changes from `XFile` to `AttachmentLocalFile`.
    *   **10/24/2025, 6:17:38 PM - 10/24/2025, 6:23:11 PM**: Period of rapid change, including fragmented code and large sections of the `uploadFile` method being commented out. This indicates active, perhaps experimental, development.
    *   **10/24/2025, 6:23:33 PM - 10/24/2025, 6:34:55 PM**: `_uploadFileToItilUseCase` is introduced as a private final field, initialized via `fsDIComponent.get()`. The `uploadFile` method is re-established to use this use case, and the constructor signature evolves multiple times to reflect DI patterns.
    *   **10/24/2025, 6:35:14 PM - 10/24/2025, 6:38:15 PM**: The `uploadFile` method is changed to accept a `List<AttachmentLocalFile>`. Logic is added to immediately update the UI model (`onModelChanged`) by setting new attachments to `AttachmentUploadStateInProgress` using `getCurrentModel().copyWith(...)`.
    *   **10/24/2025, 7:00:08 PM - 10/24/2025, 7:03:25 PM**: The `retryUpload`, `removeAttachment`, `cancelUpload`, and `dispose` methods are fully commented out. This suggests a design decision to narrow the `FsAttachmentController`'s responsibility, possibly focusing it solely on initiating uploads and immediate UI state updates, while delegating the full lifecycle management to another layer (e.g., the BLoC).

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile\_flutter\_freshservice/libraries/fs\_lib/form\_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/di/form\_lib\_ui\_fields\_module.dart**
    *   **10/24/2025, 6:38:54 PM**: Registers `FormItilAttachmentUploadBloc`, `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateFieldValidator`, and `FormItilAttachmentUploadService` with the DI container.
    *   **10/24/2025, 6:39:16 PM**: The `FormItilAttachmentUploadService` registration is replaced with `FsAttachmentController`, reflecting the shift in attachment management responsibility.
    *   **10/24/2025, 6:39:52 PM**: The registration of `FsAttachmentController` is removed. This implies that `FsAttachmentController` is now instantiated directly within `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` (as seen in later changes to that file), rather than being retrieved from the global DI container.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/24/2025, 6:14:48 PM**: `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` undergoes a major refactor to integrate with `flutter_bloc` more formally.
*   **10/24/2025, 6:15:19 PM**: Introduction of `FsAttachmentController`, marking the start of externalizing attachment logic.
*   **10/24/2025, 6:23:11 PM**: Large sections of `FsAttachmentController` are commented out, signaling a significant architectural reconsideration or active re-implementation.
*   **10/24/2025, 6:39:16 PM**: Dependency injection configuration in `form_lib_ui_fields_module.dart` shifts to register `FsAttachmentController`.
*   **10/24/2025, 6:39:52 PM**: `FsAttachmentController` registration is removed from DI, indicating a change in its instantiation strategy.
*   **10/24/2025, 6:48:35 PM**: `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` starts delegating its attachment management methods to the new `_controller` instance.
*   **10/24/2025, 7:00:08 PM**: `FsAttachmentController` drastically narrows its scope by commenting out several methods, focusing its role.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Attachment Feature Refactoring**: The entire log illustrates a concentrated effort to refactor and improve the attachment handling mechanism, moving from direct BLoC interaction in UI widgets to a more encapsulated `FsAttachmentController`.
*   **Incremental Development and Experimentation**: The frequent commenting out and re-introduction of code (especially in `fs_attachment_controller.dart`) suggests an iterative development process, possibly with experimentation on the optimal architecture for attachment management.
*   **State Management Evolution**: There's a clear evolution in state management, starting with direct BLoC interaction, then formalizing it with `BlocProvider`/`BlocBuilder`, and finally abstracting it further behind a controller.
*   **Dependency Injection (`fsDIComponent`)**: The project heavily relies on a custom dependency injection mechanism (`fsDIComponent`) for providing services and blocs throughout the application.
*   **Detailed Logging**: `FSLogger.logWithTag` is consistently used across all files to provide detailed insights into execution flow and component states, crucial for debugging and understanding complex asynchronous operations like file uploads.
*   **UI Model Updates (`onChanged`)**: A recurring pattern is the use of an `onChanged` callback to update the UI model (`FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`) whenever attachment states or lists change, ensuring the UI reflects the latest data.

## 8:04:17 PM
The code change log primarily focuses on updates to two Flutter/Dart files related to attachment handling within a form library: `fs_attachment_controller.dart` and `fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`. All changes occurred on `10/24/2025` between approximately `7:05 PM` and `7:30 PM`, indicating a concentrated development effort.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_attachment_controller.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 7:05:34 PM - 7:05:43 PM:** The `uploadFile` method's parameter name was changed from `attachment` to `newAttachments` (originally `attachment` to `attachmentList`, then `newAttachments`), and the list of `originalAttachments` was updated to `addAll` the new attachments.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 7:07:57 PM - 7:09:16 PM:**
        *   A private constant `_tag` for logging was introduced.
        *   Extensive `FSLogger.logWithTag` calls were added within the `uploadFile` method to provide detailed tracing of attachment uploads, including current and new attachments, and model updates with "InProgress" states. An import for `package:fs_logger/fs_logger.dart;` was added.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 7:21:48 PM - 7:24:51 PM (Significant Refactoring):**
        *   The `_uploadFileToItilUseCase` dependency was made nullable (`UploadFileToItilUseCase?`) and explicitly set to `null` in the `dispose` method, suggesting a cleanup pattern.
        *   The `uploadFile` method underwent a major rework:
            *   It now first updates the UI model with all new attachments set to `AttachmentUploadStateInProgress`.
            *   It then initiates *parallel uploads* for all `newAttachments` using `Future.wait`.
            *   For each individual attachment upload, it calls the `_uploadFileToItilUseCase` and immediately updates the model via `onModelChanged` with the `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` (including `attachmentId`) or `AttachmentUploadStateError` as soon as that specific upload completes. This provides real-time feedback for individual attachments.
            *   Null-safety operators (`?.call`) were applied when invoking `_uploadFileToItilUseCase`.
        *   Several old, commented-out sections of code related to sequential uploads, retry, remove, and cancel functionalities remained commented.

2.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 7:09:42 PM (Initial Refactoring):**
        *   An import for `package:fs_logger/fs_logger.dart;` and a `_tag` constant were added.
        *   The `_addMultipleAttachments` method was significantly refactored. Previously, it contained a substantial amount of BLoC-related logic (which was entirely commented out). The new implementation delegates the attachment upload process directly to an instance of `FsAttachmentController`.
        *   Similarly, the logic within `_removeAttachment` and `_retryAttachmentUpload` was commented out, indicating planned or in-progress refactoring to also delegate these operations to the controller.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 7:26:31 PM - 7:27:00 PM:** The `_controller` instance, initially a `late final` field, was moved inside the `buildField` method, implying it is now recreated on every widget rebuild. The `getCurrentModel` callback for the controller was briefly changed to `() => widget.model` then back to `() => model`.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/24/2025, 7:27:35 PM - 7:30:51 PM:**
        *   The `Builder` widget wrapping the `Column` in `buildField` was removed, simplifying the widget tree.
        *   The `_showAttachmentPicker` method's signature was updated to accept the `FsAttachmentController` instance as a parameter, and it's now explicitly passed in the `onPressed` callback.
        *   The `_addMultipleAttachments` method's signature was also updated to accept the `FsAttachmentController` instance, and it uses this passed controller to call `uploadFile`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Refactoring towards a Controller Pattern:** A dominant pattern is the shift of attachment handling logic from what appears to be a BLoC-based approach (evident from the extensive commented-out BLoC code in `fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`) to a more dedicated `FsAttachmentController`. This suggests a move towards a cleaner separation of concerns, where the `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` acts as the view, delegating business logic to the `FsAttachmentController`.
*   **Enhanced Logging:** `FSLogger.logWithTag` is consistently used across both files to provide detailed insights into the state and flow of attachment operations.
*   **Real-time UI Updates during Upload:** The refactoring in `fs_attachment_controller.dart` specifically implements a mechanism to update the UI model with the status of each attachment (`InProgress`, `Success`, `Error`) as soon as its individual upload completes, rather than waiting for all uploads to finish.
*   **Null Safety Adoption:** The use of nullable types (`?`) and null-aware operators (`?.`) for `_uploadFileToItilUseCase` and its `call` method demonstrates an adherence to Dart's null safety features.
*   **Parallel Processing for Multiple Attachments:** The `uploadFile` method in `FsAttachmentController` was explicitly modified to handle multiple attachments concurrently, improving efficiency for batch uploads.
