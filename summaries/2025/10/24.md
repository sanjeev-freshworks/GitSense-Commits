# Activity Summary for 10/24/2025

## 9:04:20 AM
The changes log a series of updates on 10/24/2025, primarily between 8:41 AM and 8:48 AM, focusing on enhancing attachment upload functionality and state management within the Freshservice mobile application's Flutter libraries.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/data/model/attachment/attachment_upload_state.dart` (8:41:33 AM):**
    *   Introduced a `sealed class` `AttachmentUploadState` with distinct subclasses: `AttachmentUploadStateInitial`, `AttachmentUploadStateInProgress`, `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess`, and `AttachmentUploadStateError`.
    *   `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` was defined to hold an `attachmentId` (an integer).
*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/fields/form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model.dart` (8:42:33 AM):**
    *   The `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` class was updated to include a `Map<AttachmentLocalFile, AttachmentUploadState> uploadResultMap` to track the state of individual attachments.
    *   Its `copyWith`, `operator ==`, `hashCode`, and `copyValueFrom` methods were modified to incorporate this new map.
    *   The `getDomainModels` method was updated to extract `attachmentId` values only from attachments that are in an `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` state.
*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/form_attachment_upload_bloc.dart` (8:43:05 AM and 8:43:40 AM):**
    *   The `uploadAttachment` method in `FormAttachmentUploadBloc` was refined. Initially, it passed the `ItilAttachment` object (`value`) directly to `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` (8:43:05 AM).
    *   A subsequent correction (8:43:40 AM) changed this to correctly extract the `id` property from the `ItilAttachment` object (`value.id`) when creating `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess`, aligning it with the `attachmentId` constructor parameter.
    *   Logging was added to trace the upload process and attachment removal events.
*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/test/ui/bloc/form_attachment_upload_bloc_test.dart` (8:44:05 AM):**
    *   This file received extensive updates to unit tests for the `FormAttachmentUploadBloc`.
    *   `setUpAll` was added to provide dummy data for `UCResult<ItilAttachment>`, `AttachmentLocalFile`, and `ItilAttachment`.
    *   New `blocTest` cases were introduced to verify:
        *   Single and multiple attachment uploads (success and failure) when `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentAdded` is triggered.
        *   Attachment removal scenarios when `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentRemoved` is triggered.
        *   Retry logic for both successful and failed uploads when `FSFormAttachmentEventOnRetry` is triggered.
    *   Test expectations for `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` were updated to assert against `attachmentId` (an integer).
*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/test/ui/fields/model/fields/form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model_test.dart` (Multiple entries: 8:45:32 AM, 8:45:40 AM, 8:45:54 AM, 8:46:08 AM, 8:46:17 AM, 8:46:27 AM, 8:46:35 AM):**
    *   These rapid updates to the same test file corrected the test fixtures for `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`.
    *   Specifically, `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` instances in `copyValueFrom`, `getDomainModels`, and `equality` tests were updated to use `attachmentId: [int]` instead of `attachment: ItilAttachment(...)`, ensuring consistency with the `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` constructor.
*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/test/ui/fields/presentation/validator/impl/helper/form_item_attachment_field_validator_expected_io.dart` (8:46:52 AM and 8:48:34 AM):**
    *   Test fixtures within this file, particularly `_validCaseWithSuccessfulUploads`, were updated.
    *   `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` instantiations were corrected to use `attachmentId: [int]` instead of providing a full `ItilAttachment` object, aligning with the model definition.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/24/2025, 8:41:33 AM:** Definition of the core `AttachmentUploadState` sealed class.
*   **10/24/2025, 8:42:33 AM:** Integration of `AttachmentUploadState` into the UI model.
*   **10/24/2025, 8:43:40 AM:** Critical fix in the BLoC to correctly extract `attachmentId` from `ItilAttachment`.
*   **10/24/2025, 8:44:05 AM:** Major update to `form_attachment_upload_bloc_test.dart`, adding comprehensive test cases.
*   **10/24/2025, 8:45:32 AM - 8:46:35 AM:** A series of rapid, iterative corrections in `form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model_test.dart` to fix test data consistency.
*   **10/24/2025, 8:46:52 AM - 8:48:34 AM:** Further corrections in `form_item_attachment_field_validator_expected_io.dart` to maintain test data consistency.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Attachment Upload State Management:** The overarching theme is the introduction and robust implementation of state management for attachment uploads, moving from a simpler model to one that tracks explicit states (initial, in progress, success, error).
*   **Focus on `attachmentId`:** The `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` is consistently defined and used to store only the `attachmentId` (an integer), rather than a full `ItilAttachment` object, simplifying the state. This is reflected across the model, BLoC, and tests.
*   **Iterative Test Refinement:** There's a clear pattern of initial implementation followed by a series of rapid, granular updates to test files. These corrections primarily ensure that test fixtures and expectations match the exact constructor signature of `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` and the revised business logic. This suggests a thorough testing approach and attention to detail during development.
*   **Tight Development Window:** All changes occurred within a relatively short period on the same day, indicating focused development activity on this specific feature.
