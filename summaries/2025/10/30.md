*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper.dart` (10/29/2025, 7:11:02 PM)**: A dedicated `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper` was implemented to convert attachment-specific `JourneyFormField` into `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel`, specifically handling cases where `supportedTypes` might be null.
*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart` (Multiple changes between 7:01:06 PM and 7:15:10 PM)**: Tests for `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper` were refined. Key changes included removing an unnecessary fixture import and updating test expectations to reflect the mapper's behavior of returning `null` for `attachmentExtensionConfig` when `supportedTypes` are null.
*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/testfixture/ui/form_detail/journey_activity_form_field_ui_model_fixture.dart` (Multiple changes between 7:40:57 PM and 9:00:37 PM)**: This fixture file, used for UI testing, provided a detailed mock of `JourneyActivityFormUIModel` containing a wide array of form field types. No functional changes were observed in the multiple log entries for this file.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/29/2025, 3:24:04 PM - 3:27:35 PM**: Initial setup and rapid refinement of `search_lib/pubspec.yaml`, adding and then adjusting dependencies.
*   **10/29/2025, 3:53:41 PM - 4:10:50 PM**: Progressive development and structuring of `SearchLibRepositoryImpl` and `SearchLibRemoteDataSource`.
*   **10/29/2025, 4:06:45 PM - 4:08:48 PM**: Iterative development of `search_lib_data_module.dart`, establishing the DI for the data layer.
*   **10/29/2025, 4:16:08 PM**: Integration of the `SearchLibDataModule` into the main `SearchLibModule`.
*   **10/29/2025, 4:20:36 PM - 4:27:10 PM**: Integration of `SearchLibModule` into the `fsmodule` application's `FSModuleDIModule`.
*   **10/29/2025, 4:31:19 PM**: Finalizing exports in `search_lib.dart` for localization and DI.
*   **10/29/2025, 4:32:43 PM**: Correct integration of `SearchLibLocalizations.delegates` into `fs_module_app_widget.dart`.
*   **10/29/2025, 4:47:56 PM**: Completion of the DI test for `search_lib`, confirming correct dependency registration.
*   **10/29/2025, 5:08:01 PM**: Finalization of `intl_en.arb` for `search_lib` with parameterized localization strings.
*   **10/29/2025, 7:11:02 PM**: Implementation of the specialized `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper` in `journey_lib`.
*   **10/29/2025, 7:12:44 PM - 7:15:10 PM**: Updates to `journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart` to align with the new mapper logic for null `supportedTypes`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Layered Architecture (Data, Domain, UI)**: The `search_lib` is structured with clear separation into data, domain, and UI layers, each having its own DI module. This is a common pattern in Flutter projects for maintainability and testability.
*   **Dependency Injection (`fsDIComponent`)**: Extensive use of a DI framework (`fsDIComponent`, likely GetIt) for registering and resolving dependencies as lazy singletons. This appears to be a standard practice across different libraries (e.g., `search_lib`, `support_portal_lib`).
*   **Localization (`l10n`)**: The adoption of Flutter's internationalization system is evident with the creation of `intl_en.arb` and its integration into the main app's localization delegates.
*   **Test-Driven Development / Unit Testing**: The immediate creation and refinement of `_di_module.dart` and `_module_test.dart` files for `search_lib` demonstrate a commitment to testing the core architectural components.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: Many files show multiple, closely-timed changes, often involving minor corrections (typos, incomplete code snippets), additions of imports, or progressive refactoring, indicating active and iterative development during a single session.
*   **Attachment Field Handling**: A specific focus on `journey_lib` involves detailed mapping and testing for attachment form fields, suggesting complex requirements for file uploads and display within forms.

*   **10/29/2025, 4:20 PM - 4:27 PM:** Integration of `SearchLibModule` into the `fsmodule` application's main DI module and its `pubspec.yaml`.
*   **10/29/2025, 4:32 PM - 5:32 PM:** Integration of `SearchLibLocalizations` into `fsmodule`'s main application widget, with ongoing adjustments to localization delegate registration.
*   **10/29/2025, 4:42 PM - 4:47 PM:** Concurrent development of `search_lib`'s test DI module and its corresponding test cases, including refactoring from copied code and verifying DI registrations.
*   **10/29/2025, 5:05 PM - 5:08 PM:** Iterative creation and refinement of `search_lib`'s English localization file (`intl_en.arb`).
*   **10/29/2025, 7:11:02 PM:** A major refactoring or replacement of `journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart`, changing it to `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper` to specialize in attachment field mapping.
*   **10/29/2025, 7:12:44 PM:** Adjustment of test expectations in `journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart` to match the updated mapper logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Layered Architecture and Dependency Injection:** A consistent pattern of separating code into data, domain, and UI layers, each with its own dependency injection (DI) module (`_data_module`, `_domain_module`, `_ui_module`), and a central module (`_module`) to orchestrate them. The `fsDIComponent` is heavily used for `registerLazySingleton`, indicating a centralized service locator or DI container approach.
*   **Library-Based Development:** New features are developed as independent libraries (e.g., `search_lib`, `support_portal_lib`) and then integrated into the main application. The libraries follow a `[feature]_lib` naming convention.
*   **Rapid Iteration and Refactoring:** Multiple timestamps show very quick, incremental changes (often within seconds or minutes), suggesting an active development process that involves frequent saves, small changes, and refactoring, sometimes with temporary placeholder code or typos quickly corrected.
*   **Localization (`l10n`):** The creation of `.arb` files and their inclusion in the main app's `localizationsDelegates` demonstrates a commitment to internationalization.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD) / Thorough Testing:** The presence and meticulous development of DI test modules and unit tests (`_di_module.dart`, `_module_test.dart`) for `search_lib` (and `support_portal_lib` as a model) highlight a practice of validating the dependency setup and component behavior.
*   **Flutter Ecosystem:** The use of `pubspec.yaml`, Flutter SDK versions, and Flutter-specific packages (e.g., `flutter_bloc`, `go_router`, `flutter_test`, `flutter_localizations`) clearly indicates a Flutter mobile application development environment.
*   **Copy-Paste-and-Adapt:** The initial state of `search_lib`'s test DI module showing elements from `support_portal_lib` suggests a common practice of copying an existing structure and adapting it for a new feature.
