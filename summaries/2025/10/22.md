# Activity Summary for 10/22/2025

## 12:10:49 AM
The changes log details iterative modifications to a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`, over a short period.

The most significant update occurred between **10/21/2025, 11:07:25 PM** and **10/21/2025, 11:07:31 PM**. This update refined the logic within the `_addMultipleAttachments` method, specifically inside the `bloc.stream.listen` callback when handling `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted`.

**Key Change:**
Previously, at 11:07:25 PM, when an `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted` state was processed, a new map named `uploadResultMap` was created from the existing `uploadStateMap`. Then, `uploadStateMap` was updated with the new state (`uploadStateMap[state.file] = state.uploadState;`). However, the `uploadedModel` was copied using the *old* `uploadResultMap` (which was a copy before the latest state update), rather than the directly modified `uploadStateMap`.

By 11:07:31 PM, this was corrected. The redundant creation of `uploadResultMap` was removed. Instead, `uploadStateMap` is directly updated, and `uploadedModel` is then copied using this *updated* `uploadStateMap`. This ensures that the `uploadedModel` correctly reflects the current upload status of attachments.

Subsequent entries at **10/21/2025, 11:07:36 PM** and **10/21/2025, 11:08:00 PM** show no further code alterations for this file, indicating that the fix implemented around 11:07:31 PM was the final change in this sequence.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**
The log demonstrates focused work on a specific part of the attachment handling logic within a Flutter Bloc context. All changes are concentrated on ensuring the `uploadResultMap` accurately reflects the state of attachment uploads, particularly when new attachments are added or their upload status changes. The tight timestamps suggest a rapid cycle of testing and refinement for this particular piece of functionality. The use of `FSLogger.logWithTag` is consistent across all versions, indicating robust logging practices.

## 8:03:30 AM
The provided log details a series of iterative changes focused on implementing and refining an attachment management feature within a Flutter application using the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern. All changes occurred on October 22, 2025, primarily between 1:17 AM and 8:01 AM, indicating a concentrated development session.

Here's a summary of the key information:

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/model/fs_form_attachment_state.dart`**
    *   **Early Updates (1:17 AM - 1:18 AM):** Initial definition of `FSFormAttachmentState` as a sealed class with `Initial`, `Loading`, and `UploadAttempted` states. The `FSFormAttachmentStateRemoved` state was introduced shortly after.
    *   **Iterative Refinement of `Removed` State (1:29 AM - 1:33 AM):** The `FSFormAttachmentStateRemoved` class underwent multiple changes and corrections. It evolved from simply carrying a `file` to incorporating `originalFiles` (a list of all files before removal) and `removedFile` (the specific file removed), along with `uploadStatesMap` for a brief period, before settling on `remainingFiles` and `removedFile`. This refinement aimed to provide more comprehensive context about the attachment state after a removal operation. A commented-out `FSFormAttachmentStateError` with a `fixme` note indicates pending error handling.

2.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/fs_form_base_attachment_bloc.dart`**
    *   **Initial BLoC Structure (1:19 AM):** Established an abstract `FSFormBaseAttachmentBloc` to handle attachment-related events (`OnAttachmentAdded`, `OnAttachmentRemoved`, `OnRetry`). It defined abstract methods for `uploadAttachment` and `removeAttachment`.
    *   **`removeAttachment` Signature Evolution (1:19 AM - 1:31 AM):** The `removeAttachment` method's signature and implementation within the base BLoC were highly volatile. It started with an incomplete definition, gained a placeholder implementation, and then was made abstract. Crucially, its parameters shifted from a generic `AttachmentType` or single `AttachmentLocalFile` to requiring both `List<AttachmentLocalFile> originalFiles` and `AttachmentLocalFile removedFile` (1:31 AM). This change directly aligns with the `fs_form_attachment_state.dart` updates to provide more context during removal.
    *   **Event Handler Refinements (1:20 AM - 1:31 AM):** The `on<FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentRemoved>` event handler underwent numerous corrections, addressing typos, duplicate handlers, and mismatches between the event payload and the `removeAttachment` method's expected parameters.

3.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/model/fs_form_attachment_event.dart`**
    *   **Event Definition (1:20 AM):** Defined `FSFormAttachmentEvent` with `OnAttachmentAdded`, `OnAttachmentRemoved`, and `OnRetry` events.
    *   **`OnAttachmentRemoved` Contextualization (1:24 AM - 1:33 AM):** The `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentRemoved` event was made generic and its payload was enhanced. It initially carried a single `attachment` or `file`, but was later updated to carry `List<AttachmentLocalFile> originalFiles` and `AttachmentLocalFile removedFile` (1:33 AM). This change provides the necessary context for the BLoC to process removal operations effectively.

4.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/form_attachment_upload_bloc.dart`**
    *   **Upload Implementation (1:26 AM):** This concrete BLoC implements `uploadAttachment` by iterating through attachments, emitting `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading` and `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted` states, and using `UploadFileToItilUseCase` for actual file uploads. It tracks upload status for each file (`AttachmentUploadStateInProgress`, `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess`, `AttachmentUploadStateError`).
    *   **`removeAttachment` Implementation (1:27 AM - 1:34 AM):** The `removeAttachment` method was initially left unimplemented (`UnimplementedError`) but was later fully implemented (1:34 AM). Its signature was updated to match the abstract base class, and its logic involves filtering `originalFiles` to determine `remainingFiles` and then emitting `FSFormAttachmentStateRemoved` to update the state.

5.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`**
    *   **Initial UI-BLoC Interaction (1:35 AM):** The `FSFormItemAttachmentField` widget was set up to display attachment inputs and previews. It initially used `BlocProvider` and `BlocBuilder`, and implemented stream subscriptions within `_addMultipleAttachments` to react to BLoC states directly, alongside directly modifying the UI model for removal.
    *   **Delegating State Control (1:52 AM):** A significant architectural shift occurred. The `_removeAttachment` method was refactored to dispatch an `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentRemoved` event to the BLoC, rather than directly modifying the UI model. This delegates state mutation entirely to the BLoC.
    *   **Centralized State Handling (1:52 AM):** The widget transitioned from `BlocBuilder` to `BlocConsumer` (1:52 AM). A new private method, `_handleBlocStateChange`, was introduced as the `listener` callback for `BlocConsumer`. This centralizes the logic for reacting to `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading`, `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted`, and `FSFormAttachmentStateRemoved` states, ensuring the UI model is consistently updated via `onChanged` based *only* on BLoC emissions.
    *   **Consistent Model Updates (1:54 AM - 8:01 AM):** Further refinements ensured that the `onChanged` callback is consistently and correctly invoked after every state update within the `_handleBlocStateChange` listener, and that `updatedModel` accurately reflects the latest attachment data from the BLoC.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **BLoC Pattern Enforcement:** The changes consistently demonstrate the BLoC pattern with clear separation of events, states, and business logic.
*   **Iterative Development:** Frequent, minor updates to the same files within a short timeframe indicate an iterative development style, with developers quickly making adjustments and corrections.
*   **Contextual Information:** A clear trend is the evolution of states and events to carry more contextual information (e.g., `originalFiles`, `removedFile`) rather than just the immediate affected entity. This allows for more robust and informed state management within the BLoC.
*   **Decoupling UI from Business Logic:** The `FSFormItemAttachmentField` refactor highlights a shift towards greater decoupling, moving state modification logic out of the UI widget and into the BLoC, and using `BlocConsumer`'s `listener` for centralized UI reactions.
*   **Debugging and Logging:** Extensive use of `FSLogger.logWithTag` across all BLoC and UI components indicates a strong focus on debugging and understanding the flow of events and states.
*   **Pending Error Handling:** The recurring `fixme add the error state` comment across several states suggests that a dedicated and comprehensive error handling mechanism for attachment uploads is still a planned feature.

## 9:02:52 AM
The provided log details changes exclusively to the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`.

The initial state of the file at **10/22/2025, 8:09:26 AM** shows a `FSFormItemAttachmentField` widget responsible for handling attachment uploads. It integrates with `FormAttachmentUploadBloc` for state management, including adding, removing, and retrying attachments. Notably, the `_addMultipleAttachments` method's bloc stream listener for `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted` included a conditional check `if (uploadResultMap.containsKey(state.file))` before updating the upload state. Also, there were commented-out lines for subscription cancellation and manual state updates in `_removeAttachment`, hinting at previous or alternative implementation thoughts.

By **10/22/2025, 8:31:39 AM**, a key change occurred within the `_addMultipleAttachments` method. The conditional check `if (uploadResultMap.containsKey(state.file))` inside the `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted` block was removed, making the assignment `uploadResultMap[state.file] = state.uploadState;` unconditional. This suggests a refinement where the `state.file` is now expected to always exist in the `uploadStateMap` when an upload attempt state is received.

The entry at **10/22/2025, 8:38:56 AM** shows no functional changes compared to the previous timestamp; the code content is identical, possibly indicating a re-commit or minor non-functional update.

At **10/22/2025, 9:01:35 AM**, an incomplete line `final ValueChan` was temporarily introduced into the class definition, which appears to be an accidental or partial edit.

This incomplete line was promptly removed by **10/22/2025, 9:02:01 AM**. At this timestamp, a new `final VoidCallback onAttachmentAdded;` field was added to the `FSFormItemAttachmentField` class, and its constructor was updated to require this new callback. This indicates an intention to expose an event hook for when attachments are added.

Finally, the entry at **10/22/2025, 9:02:11 AM** again presents identical code to the previous timestamp, suggesting another minor, non-functional commit.

Throughout these changes, the overall structure of the `FSFormItemAttachmentField` widget, its use of `BlocProvider` and `BlocBuilder`, and methods like `_showAttachmentPicker`, `_removeAttachment`, `_retryAttachmentUpload`, and `_showErrorAlert` remained consistent. The `FSLogger.logWithTag` is a recurring element used for debugging across all timestamps. The modifications primarily focused on fine-tuning the attachment upload state handling logic and later, adding a new callback for attachment addition events.

## 10:03:16 AM
The code changes primarily revolve around enhancing and refactoring the attachment handling within form fields, particularly for the Freshservice mobile Flutter application. A key focus is on improving the UI interactivity and separating attachment-specific logic into dedicated components and mappers.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart:**
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:03:04 AM:** The initial state of `FSFormItemAttachmentField` included an `onAttachmentAdded` callback.
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:06:41 AM:** The `onAttachmentAdded` callback was removed from the widget's constructor and its usage in `_showAttachmentPicker`. This suggests the attachment adding logic was consolidated internally or handled differently.
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:33:30 AM - 9:33:56 AM:** The `FSPlainButton` for attaching files was updated to be conditionally enabled/disabled based on `model.isEditable`. Initially, `onPressed` was set to `null` if not editable, then refactored to use an explicit `enabled: model.isEditable` property.
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:34:08 AM:** The `onAttachmentRemoved` and `onAttachmentRetry` callbacks in `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` were made conditional on `model.isEditable`, disabling these actions for non-editable fields.
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:35:12 AM:** A new `isEditable: model.isEditable` property was passed to `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot`, indicating that the preview component itself would utilize this state to manage its UI.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/activity_form/journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart:**
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:04:01 AM:** The `_buildAttachmentField` method was introduced, responsible for instantiating `FSFormItemAttachmentField` and initializing `uploadResultMap` for attachments. It included an `onAttachmentAdded` callback.
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:04:19 AM - 9:04:59 AM:** The `onAttachmentAdded` callback for `FSFormItemAttachmentField` was modified to dispatch a `FormAttachmentUploadEventAttachmentAdded` event to the `FormAttachmentUploadBloc`.
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:06:25 AM:** The `onAttachmentAdded` callback was removed from `FSFormItemAttachmentField` instantiation, aligning with the changes made in `fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart` where the callback itself was removed.
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:13:33 AM - 9:13:47 AM:** A transient, incomplete edit attempting to add `isEdi` (likely `isEditable`) to `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` was made and then reverted.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/attachment/attachment_item_preview.dart:**
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:38:13 AM:** An `isEditable` property was added to `AttachmentItemPreview`. When `isEditable` is `false`, the component hides its action buttons (close and retry), making attachments non-interactive in read-only contexts.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart:**
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:52:07 AM:** An explicit mapping for `FormFieldTypeAttachment` was added to the `switch` statement, delegating its mapping to a newly introduced `_attachmentFormFieldUIMapper`. Previously, it would fall back to `_mapCommonFields`.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper.dart:**
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:53:07 AM - 9:59:33 AM:** This file was created and iteratively developed. It started as an empty class and evolved to define `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUiMapperInput` (with `field`, `userDateTimeConfiguration`, `noOfAttachmentsAllowed`, `supportedTypes`, `attachmentExtensionConfig` properties) and the `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUiMapper` class inheriting from `BaseMapper`.
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:59:53 AM - 10:00:22 AM:** The mapper's return type was initially a typo (`UploadUiMod`), then corrected to `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`. The `protectedMap` method was implemented to construct `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` using the input data.
    *   **10/22/2025, 10:00:50 AM:** The mapping for `isRequired` and `isEditable` from the `field` object was adjusted to use `field.required` and `field.editable` respectively, aligning with domain model properties.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/mapper/common_form_field_ui_mapper.dart:**
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:55:33 AM - 10:01:20 AM:** No functional changes were recorded for this file across multiple timestamps, suggesting it remained stable while other related mappers were being developed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Dedicated Attachment Handling:** There's a clear trend towards creating specific components and logic for attachment fields, separating them from general form field handling. This is evident in the introduction of `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUiMapper` and the refinement of `FSFormItemAttachmentField`.
*   **Conditional Interactivity:** The concept of `isEditable` is consistently applied to control user interactions with attachment components, such as enabling/disabling the attachment picker button and the removal/retry options for individual attachments.
*   **BLoC Integration:** The `flutter_bloc` pattern is central, used for state management in attachment uploads and interactions, demonstrating a reactive approach to UI updates.
*   **Mapper Pattern:** The use of `BaseMapper` and distinct input/output UI models is a recurring architectural pattern for transforming domain models into UI-specific representations.
*   **Logging for Debugging:** Extensive logging using `FSLogger.logWithTag` is present throughout the modified files, indicating a focus on traceability and debugging during development of these features.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** Numerous timestamps within short intervals, especially for the `journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper.dart` file, suggest a rapid development and refinement process for the new mapper.
