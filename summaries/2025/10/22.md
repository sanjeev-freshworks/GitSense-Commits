# Activity Summary for 10/22/2025

## 12:10:49 AM
The changes log details iterative modifications to a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`, over a short period.

The most significant update occurred between **10/21/2025, 11:07:25 PM** and **10/21/2025, 11:07:31 PM**. This update refined the logic within the `_addMultipleAttachments` method, specifically inside the `bloc.stream.listen` callback when handling `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted`.

**Key Change:**
Previously, at 11:07:25 PM, when an `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted` state was processed, a new map named `uploadResultMap` was created from the existing `uploadStateMap`. Then, `uploadStateMap` was updated with the new state (`uploadStateMap[state.file] = state.uploadState;`). However, the `uploadedModel` was copied using the *old* `uploadResultMap` (which was a copy before the latest state update), rather than the directly modified `uploadStateMap`.

By 11:07:31 PM, this was corrected. The redundant creation of `uploadResultMap` was removed. Instead, `uploadStateMap` is directly updated, and `uploadedModel` is then copied using this *updated* `uploadStateMap`. This ensures that the `uploadedModel` correctly reflects the current upload status of attachments.

Subsequent entries at **10/21/2025, 11:07:36 PM** and **10/21/2025, 11:08:00 PM** show no further code alterations for this file, indicating that the fix implemented around 11:07:31 PM was the final change in this sequence.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**
The log demonstrates focused work on a specific part of the attachment handling logic within a Flutter Bloc context. All changes are concentrated on ensuring the `uploadResultMap` accurately reflects the state of attachment uploads, particularly when new attachments are added or their upload status changes. The tight timestamps suggest a rapid cycle of testing and refinement for this particular piece of functionality. The use of `FSLogger.logWithTag` is consistent across all versions, indicating robust logging practices.

## 8:03:30 AM
The provided log details a series of iterative changes focused on implementing and refining an attachment management feature within a Flutter application using the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern. All changes occurred on October 22, 2025, primarily between 1:17 AM and 8:01 AM, indicating a concentrated development session.

Here's a summary of the key information:

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/model/fs_form_attachment_state.dart`**
    *   **Early Updates (1:17 AM - 1:18 AM):** Initial definition of `FSFormAttachmentState` as a sealed class with `Initial`, `Loading`, and `UploadAttempted` states. The `FSFormAttachmentStateRemoved` state was introduced shortly after.
    *   **Iterative Refinement of `Removed` State (1:29 AM - 1:33 AM):** The `FSFormAttachmentStateRemoved` class underwent multiple changes and corrections. It evolved from simply carrying a `file` to incorporating `originalFiles` (a list of all files before removal) and `removedFile` (the specific file removed), along with `uploadStatesMap` for a brief period, before settling on `remainingFiles` and `removedFile`. This refinement aimed to provide more comprehensive context about the attachment state after a removal operation. A commented-out `FSFormAttachmentStateError` with a `fixme` note indicates pending error handling.

2.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/fs_form_base_attachment_bloc.dart`**
    *   **Initial BLoC Structure (1:19 AM):** Established an abstract `FSFormBaseAttachmentBloc` to handle attachment-related events (`OnAttachmentAdded`, `OnAttachmentRemoved`, `OnRetry`). It defined abstract methods for `uploadAttachment` and `removeAttachment`.
    *   **`removeAttachment` Signature Evolution (1:19 AM - 1:31 AM):** The `removeAttachment` method's signature and implementation within the base BLoC were highly volatile. It started with an incomplete definition, gained a placeholder implementation, and then was made abstract. Crucially, its parameters shifted from a generic `AttachmentType` or single `AttachmentLocalFile` to requiring both `List<AttachmentLocalFile> originalFiles` and `AttachmentLocalFile removedFile` (1:31 AM). This change directly aligns with the `fs_form_attachment_state.dart` updates to provide more context during removal.
    *   **Event Handler Refinements (1:20 AM - 1:31 AM):** The `on<FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentRemoved>` event handler underwent numerous corrections, addressing typos, duplicate handlers, and mismatches between the event payload and the `removeAttachment` method's expected parameters.

3.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/model/fs_form_attachment_event.dart`**
    *   **Event Definition (1:20 AM):** Defined `FSFormAttachmentEvent` with `OnAttachmentAdded`, `OnAttachmentRemoved`, and `OnRetry` events.
    *   **`OnAttachmentRemoved` Contextualization (1:24 AM - 1:33 AM):** The `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentRemoved` event was made generic and its payload was enhanced. It initially carried a single `attachment` or `file`, but was later updated to carry `List<AttachmentLocalFile> originalFiles` and `AttachmentLocalFile removedFile` (1:33 AM). This change provides the necessary context for the BLoC to process removal operations effectively.

4.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/form_attachment_upload_bloc.dart`**
    *   **Upload Implementation (1:26 AM):** This concrete BLoC implements `uploadAttachment` by iterating through attachments, emitting `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading` and `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted` states, and using `UploadFileToItilUseCase` for actual file uploads. It tracks upload status for each file (`AttachmentUploadStateInProgress`, `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess`, `AttachmentUploadStateError`).
    *   **`removeAttachment` Implementation (1:27 AM - 1:34 AM):** The `removeAttachment` method was initially left unimplemented (`UnimplementedError`) but was later fully implemented (1:34 AM). Its signature was updated to match the abstract base class, and its logic involves filtering `originalFiles` to determine `remainingFiles` and then emitting `FSFormAttachmentStateRemoved` to update the state.

5.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`**
    *   **Initial UI-BLoC Interaction (1:35 AM):** The `FSFormItemAttachmentField` widget was set up to display attachment inputs and previews. It initially used `BlocProvider` and `BlocBuilder`, and implemented stream subscriptions within `_addMultipleAttachments` to react to BLoC states directly, alongside directly modifying the UI model for removal.
    *   **Delegating State Control (1:52 AM):** A significant architectural shift occurred. The `_removeAttachment` method was refactored to dispatch an `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentRemoved` event to the BLoC, rather than directly modifying the UI model. This delegates state mutation entirely to the BLoC.
    *   **Centralized State Handling (1:52 AM):** The widget transitioned from `BlocBuilder` to `BlocConsumer` (1:52 AM). A new private method, `_handleBlocStateChange`, was introduced as the `listener` callback for `BlocConsumer`. This centralizes the logic for reacting to `FSFormAttachmentStateLoading`, `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted`, and `FSFormAttachmentStateRemoved` states, ensuring the UI model is consistently updated via `onChanged` based *only* on BLoC emissions.
    *   **Consistent Model Updates (1:54 AM - 8:01 AM):** Further refinements ensured that the `onChanged` callback is consistently and correctly invoked after every state update within the `_handleBlocStateChange` listener, and that `updatedModel` accurately reflects the latest attachment data from the BLoC.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **BLoC Pattern Enforcement:** The changes consistently demonstrate the BLoC pattern with clear separation of events, states, and business logic.
*   **Iterative Development:** Frequent, minor updates to the same files within a short timeframe indicate an iterative development style, with developers quickly making adjustments and corrections.
*   **Contextual Information:** A clear trend is the evolution of states and events to carry more contextual information (e.g., `originalFiles`, `removedFile`) rather than just the immediate affected entity. This allows for more robust and informed state management within the BLoC.
*   **Decoupling UI from Business Logic:** The `FSFormItemAttachmentField` refactor highlights a shift towards greater decoupling, moving state modification logic out of the UI widget and into the BLoC, and using `BlocConsumer`'s `listener` for centralized UI reactions.
*   **Debugging and Logging:** Extensive use of `FSLogger.logWithTag` across all BLoC and UI components indicates a strong focus on debugging and understanding the flow of events and states.
*   **Pending Error Handling:** The recurring `fixme add the error state` comment across several states suggests that a dedicated and comprehensive error handling mechanism for attachment uploads is still a planned feature.

## 9:02:52 AM
The provided log details changes exclusively to the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`.

The initial state of the file at **10/22/2025, 8:09:26 AM** shows a `FSFormItemAttachmentField` widget responsible for handling attachment uploads. It integrates with `FormAttachmentUploadBloc` for state management, including adding, removing, and retrying attachments. Notably, the `_addMultipleAttachments` method's bloc stream listener for `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted` included a conditional check `if (uploadResultMap.containsKey(state.file))` before updating the upload state. Also, there were commented-out lines for subscription cancellation and manual state updates in `_removeAttachment`, hinting at previous or alternative implementation thoughts.

By **10/22/2025, 8:31:39 AM**, a key change occurred within the `_addMultipleAttachments` method. The conditional check `if (uploadResultMap.containsKey(state.file))` inside the `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted` block was removed, making the assignment `uploadResultMap[state.file] = state.uploadState;` unconditional. This suggests a refinement where the `state.file` is now expected to always exist in the `uploadStateMap` when an upload attempt state is received.

The entry at **10/22/2025, 8:38:56 AM** shows no functional changes compared to the previous timestamp; the code content is identical, possibly indicating a re-commit or minor non-functional update.

At **10/22/2025, 9:01:35 AM**, an incomplete line `final ValueChan` was temporarily introduced into the class definition, which appears to be an accidental or partial edit.

This incomplete line was promptly removed by **10/22/2025, 9:02:01 AM**. At this timestamp, a new `final VoidCallback onAttachmentAdded;` field was added to the `FSFormItemAttachmentField` class, and its constructor was updated to require this new callback. This indicates an intention to expose an event hook for when attachments are added.

Finally, the entry at **10/22/2025, 9:02:11 AM** again presents identical code to the previous timestamp, suggesting another minor, non-functional commit.

Throughout these changes, the overall structure of the `FSFormItemAttachmentField` widget, its use of `BlocProvider` and `BlocBuilder`, and methods like `_showAttachmentPicker`, `_removeAttachment`, `_retryAttachmentUpload`, and `_showErrorAlert` remained consistent. The `FSLogger.logWithTag` is a recurring element used for debugging across all timestamps. The modifications primarily focused on fine-tuning the attachment upload state handling logic and later, adding a new callback for attachment addition events.

## 10:03:16 AM
The code changes primarily revolve around enhancing and refactoring the attachment handling within form fields, particularly for the Freshservice mobile Flutter application. A key focus is on improving the UI interactivity and separating attachment-specific logic into dedicated components and mappers.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart:**
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:03:04 AM:** The initial state of `FSFormItemAttachmentField` included an `onAttachmentAdded` callback.
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:06:41 AM:** The `onAttachmentAdded` callback was removed from the widget's constructor and its usage in `_showAttachmentPicker`. This suggests the attachment adding logic was consolidated internally or handled differently.
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:33:30 AM - 9:33:56 AM:** The `FSPlainButton` for attaching files was updated to be conditionally enabled/disabled based on `model.isEditable`. Initially, `onPressed` was set to `null` if not editable, then refactored to use an explicit `enabled: model.isEditable` property.
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:34:08 AM:** The `onAttachmentRemoved` and `onAttachmentRetry` callbacks in `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` were made conditional on `model.isEditable`, disabling these actions for non-editable fields.
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:35:12 AM:** A new `isEditable: model.isEditable` property was passed to `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot`, indicating that the preview component itself would utilize this state to manage its UI.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/activity_form/journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart:**
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:04:01 AM:** The `_buildAttachmentField` method was introduced, responsible for instantiating `FSFormItemAttachmentField` and initializing `uploadResultMap` for attachments. It included an `onAttachmentAdded` callback.
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:04:19 AM - 9:04:59 AM:** The `onAttachmentAdded` callback for `FSFormItemAttachmentField` was modified to dispatch a `FormAttachmentUploadEventAttachmentAdded` event to the `FormAttachmentUploadBloc`.
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:06:25 AM:** The `onAttachmentAdded` callback was removed from `FSFormItemAttachmentField` instantiation, aligning with the changes made in `fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart` where the callback itself was removed.
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:13:33 AM - 9:13:47 AM:** A transient, incomplete edit attempting to add `isEdi` (likely `isEditable`) to `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` was made and then reverted.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/attachment/attachment_item_preview.dart:**
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:38:13 AM:** An `isEditable` property was added to `AttachmentItemPreview`. When `isEditable` is `false`, the component hides its action buttons (close and retry), making attachments non-interactive in read-only contexts.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart:**
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:52:07 AM:** An explicit mapping for `FormFieldTypeAttachment` was added to the `switch` statement, delegating its mapping to a newly introduced `_attachmentFormFieldUIMapper`. Previously, it would fall back to `_mapCommonFields`.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper.dart:**
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:53:07 AM - 9:59:33 AM:** This file was created and iteratively developed. It started as an empty class and evolved to define `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUiMapperInput` (with `field`, `userDateTimeConfiguration`, `noOfAttachmentsAllowed`, `supportedTypes`, `attachmentExtensionConfig` properties) and the `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUiMapper` class inheriting from `BaseMapper`.
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:59:53 AM - 10:00:22 AM:** The mapper's return type was initially a typo (`UploadUiMod`), then corrected to `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`. The `protectedMap` method was implemented to construct `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` using the input data.
    *   **10/22/2025, 10:00:50 AM:** The mapping for `isRequired` and `isEditable` from the `field` object was adjusted to use `field.required` and `field.editable` respectively, aligning with domain model properties.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/mapper/common_form_field_ui_mapper.dart:**
    *   **10/22/2025, 9:55:33 AM - 10:01:20 AM:** No functional changes were recorded for this file across multiple timestamps, suggesting it remained stable while other related mappers were being developed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Dedicated Attachment Handling:** There's a clear trend towards creating specific components and logic for attachment fields, separating them from general form field handling. This is evident in the introduction of `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUiMapper` and the refinement of `FSFormItemAttachmentField`.
*   **Conditional Interactivity:** The concept of `isEditable` is consistently applied to control user interactions with attachment components, such as enabling/disabling the attachment picker button and the removal/retry options for individual attachments.
*   **BLoC Integration:** The `flutter_bloc` pattern is central, used for state management in attachment uploads and interactions, demonstrating a reactive approach to UI updates.
*   **Mapper Pattern:** The use of `BaseMapper` and distinct input/output UI models is a recurring architectural pattern for transforming domain models into UI-specific representations.
*   **Logging for Debugging:** Extensive logging using `FSLogger.logWithTag` is present throughout the modified files, indicating a focus on traceability and debugging during development of these features.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** Numerous timestamps within short intervals, especially for the `journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper.dart` file, suggest a rapid development and refinement process for the new mapper.

## 11:03:15 AM
The code change log details significant updates across several Dart files related to form field mapping, attachment handling, and UI components in a Flutter application for Freshservice. The changes span a single day, October 22, 2025.

Here's a summary of the key information:

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper.dart`**
    *   **Initial Refinement (10:03 AM - 10:06 AM):** The `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUiMapper` was iteratively updated to correctly extract `noOfAttachmentsAllowed` and `supportedFileTypes` by safely casting `input.field.fieldType` to `FormFieldTypeAttachment`.
    *   **Robustness and Null Safety (10:08 AM - 10:09 AM):** The mapper's return type was made nullable (`FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel?`), and logic was added to check if `fieldType` is indeed `FormFieldTypeAttachment`. This was further refined to use a nullable `FormFieldTypeAttachment?` variable with null-safe accessors (`?.`).
    *   **Attachment Data Mapping (10:55 AM - 10:56 AM):** The `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` was extended to include an `attachments` list. A new private helper method, `_mapAttachmentLocalFile`, was introduced to convert `Attachment` objects (from `fieldType?.values`) into `AttachmentLocalFile` objects, populating the `attachments` list. A `TODO` comment was added, indicating this is a temporary implementation.

2.  **`/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart`**
    *   **Attachment Mapper Integration (10:10 AM - 10:11 AM):** The `_attachmentFormFieldUIMapper` method was implemented to correctly utilize the `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUiMapper` for mapping attachment fields.
    *   **Dependency Injection Refactoring (10:11 AM - 10:13 AM):** The `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUiMapper` dependency was refined. Initially, it was instantiated directly within a method, then as a private class member, and finally, it was properly injected via the constructor (`_journeyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper`), making the class more testable and adhering to better architectural practices.
    *   **Method Renaming (10:12 PM - 10:13 PM):** The `_attachmentFormFieldUIMapper` private method was renamed to `_mapAttachment` for clarity.
    *   **Await Clarification (10:14 PM):** Explicit `await` was added to the call of `_mapAttachment` within the switch statement, clarifying asynchronous operation.

3.  **`/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/attachment/attachment_item_card.dart`**
    *   **Conditional Styling (10:53 AM - 10:58 AM):** This UI component underwent several rapid changes to implement conditional styling for the card's background `color`. The goal was to make non-editable cards visually distinct. After a few attempts, it settled on using `isEditable ? fillColor : context.theme.fsColorScheme.fill.semantic.error.bold` for the card's background color, implying a disabled or error-like visual for non-editable states.

4.  **`/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/attachment/attachment_item_preview.dart`**
    *   **Editability Propagated (10:59 AM):** The `isEditable` property, which controls the visibility of action buttons, was also passed to the inner `FSListTile` widget as `enabled: isEditable`, likely affecting its interactive state.

5.  **`/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/form_attachment_upload_bloc.dart`**
    *   **Code Cleanup (11:01 AM):** Minor cleanup was performed by removing commented-out lines within the `uploadAttachment` method, which handles the logic for uploading attachments to an ITIL system. The bloc manages the upload state (in progress, success, error) for individual attachments.

6.  **`/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/model/fs_form_attachment_state.dart`**
    *   This file defines the sealed class `FSFormAttachmentState` and its various subclasses (`Initial`, `Removed`, `Loading`, `UploadAttempted`), which represent different states in the attachment upload process. No specific changes were recorded within the provided log for this file, indicating its foundational role.

7.  **`/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/activity_form/journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart`**
    *   **Attachment Field Rendering (11:02 AM):** The `_buildAttachmentField` method was noted to properly process `FormAttachmentFieldUIModel` instances by creating `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` objects. This ensures that existing upload results are preserved or new ones are initialized as `AttachmentUploadStateInitial`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/22/2025, 10:05 AM - 10:09 AM:** `journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper.dart` received substantial updates for safe field type casting, null safety, and making the mapper return nullable.
*   **10/22/2025, 10:11 AM - 10:13 AM:** `journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart` saw critical refactoring regarding dependency injection and method renaming for its attachment mapping logic.
*   **10/22/2025, 10:54 AM:** `attachment_item_card.dart` had multiple rapid changes to implement conditional background styling based on editability.
*   **10/22/2025, 10:55 AM:** `journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper.dart` was updated to map existing attachments into the UI model.
*   **10/22/2025, 10:59 AM:** `attachment_item_preview.dart` extended editability control to the `FSListTile` component.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Attachment Feature Development:** A consistent theme is the development and refinement of attachment-related functionality, including UI representation (`AttachmentItemCard`, `AttachmentItemPreview`), data mapping (`JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUiMapper`), and state management (`FormAttachmentUploadBloc`).
*   **Mapper Pattern:** The widespread use of "Mapper" classes (`JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUiMapper`, `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper`, `CommonFormFieldUIMapper`) highlights an architectural pattern focused on separating business logic and UI presentation.
*   **Dependency Management:** There's a clear evolution towards improved dependency injection, moving from direct instantiation to constructor-based injection for better testability and modularity.
*   **Robustness and Error Handling:** Changes in mappers show an emphasis on robust code by handling potential null values and ensuring correct type casting using null-safe operators and conditional checks.
*   **UI Theming and State:** UI components are being updated to reflect different states (e.g., upload failed, editable/non-editable) through dynamic styling using `fsColorScheme`.
*   **Incremental Development:** Many individual log entries show very small, targeted changes, indicating an iterative development process.

## 12:03:26 PM
The code changes primarily focus on enhancing and testing attachment management within the Freshservice mobile application, particularly for form fields that handle ITIL attachments. The updates span several files, indicating a concerted effort around this functionality between 11:04 AM and 11:59 AM on 10/22/2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/bloc/form_attachment_upload_bloc.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 11:04:03 AM - 11:04:31 AM**
    *   This file defines `FormAttachmentUploadBloc`, responsible for handling the upload, removal, and state management of ITIL attachments. It extends `FSFormBaseAttachmentBloc` and uses `UploadFileToItilUseCase`.
    *   The `uploadAttachment` method initializes attachments to `AttachmentUploadStateInProgress`, then iteratively uploads each, updating its state to `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` or `AttachmentUploadStateError` as results are received from `UploadFileToItilUseCase`.
    *   The `removeAttachment` method updates the state to reflect a removed attachment.
    *   Minor changes involved adding `const` to `FSFormAttachmentStateInitial()` and `AttachmentUploadStateInProgress()` for constructor initialization and object creation, respectively, likely for performance or best practice adherence.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/model/form_attachment_field_type.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 11:05:04 AM**
    *   Introduced a `sealed class FormAttachmentFieldType` with two concrete implementations: `FormAttachmentFieldTypeAttachment` and `FormAttachmentFieldTypeItilAttachment`. The `ItilAttachment` type specifically encapsulates `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`, indicating a structured approach to distinguish and manage attachment types.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 11:05:09 AM - 11:13:26 AM**
    *   This Flutter widget, `FSFormItemAttachmentField`, acts as the UI for attachment input fields. It leverages `BlocProvider` to interact with `FormAttachmentUploadBloc`.
    *   It provides functionality to show an attachment picker, add new attachments (which dispatches an `FSFormAttachmentEventOnAttachmentAdded` event), and handles bloc state changes to update the UI with upload progress, success, or errors.
    *   It uses `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` to display the list of attachments and their states, offering options to remove or retry uploads.
    *   A commented-out `Future.delayed` block related to stream subscription cancellation was removed at 11:13:26 AM, suggesting a cleanup or refactoring of the attachment stream handling.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/attachment/attachment_item_preview_root.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 11:05:20 AM**
    *   This `StatelessWidget` is responsible for rendering a list of `AttachmentItemPreview` widgets, displaying individual attachment files along with their current `AttachmentUploadState`. It also provides callbacks for `onAttachmentRemoved` and `onAttachmentRetry`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/activity_form/journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 11:05:58 AM**
    *   This `StatefulWidget` displays various form fields for an activity. Crucially, its `_buildAttachmentField` method converts a generic `FormAttachmentFieldUIModel` into a `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`, ensuring that all attachments are initialized with an `AttachmentUploadStateInitial()` in the `uploadResultMap` before being passed to `FSFormItemAttachmentField`. It also includes logic for scrolling to specific form fields.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/base/fs_form_base_field.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 11:13:53 AM**
    *   An abstract `FSFormBaseField` class was updated (or created) to serve as a base for all form fields, providing common UI elements like a label and error message, with the actual field input implemented by subclasses via `buildField`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 11:26:55 AM - 11:41:54 AM**
    *   This file contains comprehensive unit tests for `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper`.
    *   Tests cover various scenarios: mapping attachment fields with values, without values, with null extension configurations, and mapping non-attachment field types.
    *   Initially, tests used single `expect` statements, but around 11:40:12 AM and 11:40:42 AM, specific test cases ("map - attachment field with values" and "map - attachment field with null extension config") were refactored to use multiple granular `expect` statements for detailed assertion of each property of the mapped `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`.
    *   A series of identical commits between 11:32 AM and 11:37 AM suggest re-saves or minor unrecorded changes.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/test/ui/bloc/form_attachment_upload_bloc_test.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 11:46:52 AM - 11:59:20 AM**
    *   After initial empty commits, this file received a major update at 11:59:20 AM, introducing extensive `bloc_test` suites for `FormAttachmentUploadBloc`.
    *   Tests validate attachment addition (single/multiple, success/failure), removal (from list, last item), and retry operations (success/failure), asserting correct state transitions and data updates. `mockito` is used for `UploadFileToItilUseCase`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/test/testfixture/ui/model/fields/form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model_fixture.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 11:48:16 AM**
    *   Introduced `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModelFixture` to generate predefined `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` instances for testing, facilitating consistent test data.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/test/testfixture/domain/attachment/itil_attachment_fixture.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 11:51:39 AM - 11:56:54 AM**
    *   Multiple identical commits introduced `ItilAttachmentFixture`, a utility class for generating mock `ItilAttachment` objects, standardizing test data for ITIL attachment-related tests.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Attachment-Centric Development**: A clear and strong focus on the complete lifecycle of attachment handling – from UI input to bloc logic and testing – is evident across all changes.
*   **BLoC Architecture**: The use of `flutter_bloc` is a central architectural pattern for managing state, events, and business logic related to attachments.
*   **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive unit tests using `bloc_test`, `test`, and `mockito` are consistently applied to validate the behavior of attachment-related blocs and mappers. The use of fixture classes (`FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModelFixture`, `ItilAttachmentFixture`) for generating test data is a recurring pattern.
*   **UI-Model Separation**: There's a clear distinction and mapping between backend/domain models and UI-specific models (`FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`), handled by mappers.
*   **Logging**: `FSLogger.logWithTag` is frequently used within bloc and UI components for debugging and tracking application flow.
*   **`const` Keyword Optimization**: Repeated additions of `const` to constructors and state objects (`FSFormAttachmentStateInitial`, `AttachmentUploadStateInProgress`) suggest an emphasis on immutability and potential compile-time performance enhancements.
*   **Concentrated Development**: The timestamps indicate a rapid succession of changes, all within approximately one hour on 10/22/2025, pointing to a dedicated development sprint or refactoring session for attachment functionality.

## 2:04:21 PM
The changes log primarily revolves around the `journey_lib` Flutter library, focusing on the handling and testing of form fields, particularly attachment fields, within a UI context.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/testfixture/ui/form_detail/journey_activity_form_field_ui_model_fixture.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 1:23:36 PM**: This file defines a `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIModelFixture` class that generates a comprehensive `JourneyActivityFormUIModel` containing various form field types like text, paragraph, number, decimal, URL, choices (checkbox, radio, dropdown, multi-select, dependent), date time, email, content, and attachment.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 1:23:48 PM**: A significant update to the `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` within the `cf_df_attachment` field was introduced, adding an `uploadResultMap: {}` property.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 1:23:59 PM**: The `const` keyword was removed from the `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` constructor for the `cf_df_attachment` field, suggesting it might now be expected to be a mutable object or relies on non-const values.

2.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 1:27:25 PM**: This new file introduces `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper`, a mapper class responsible for converting `JourneyFormField` objects into `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` for UI presentation. It extracts and maps various attachment-related properties such as ID, name, label, required status, editability, allowed attachment count, supported file types, and attachment extension configuration. Crucially, it initializes `uploadResultMap: {}` and includes a `_mapAttachmentLocalFile` helper with a "TODO - temporary implementation" comment, indicating pending refinement for attachment conversion logic.

3.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 1:28:36 PM**: This test file was initially created to thoroughly test the `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper`. It includes test cases for mapping attachment fields with and without values, with and without an extension configuration, and for non-attachment field types. It validates all mapped properties, including the newly introduced `uploadResultMap`.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 1:28:46 PM**: The expected `id` for the "attachment field with no values" test case was updated from `'cf_df_attachment_empty'` to `'3e9b3693-47ab-4c84-b5b5-077ab772964f'`, aligning it with the fixture's ID.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 1:29:01 PM**: No functional code changes were observed in this timestamp.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 1:29:47 PM**: The expected `id` for "attachment field with no values" was changed again, this time to a new ID: `'4f9c4794-58bc-4d95-c6c6-188bc883075e'`. Additionally, the `id` expectation for the "attachment field with null extension config" test was made explicit to `'3e9b3693-47ab-4c84-b5b5-077ab772964f'`.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 1:30:08 PM**: The expected `id` for the "non-attachment field type" test was corrected from the generic `'cf_df_text'` to its specific fixture ID: `'c401bb0b-0113-4e65-827c-981b00ab39d1'`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on Attachment Field Enhancements**: The most prominent pattern is the concentrated effort on enhancing the `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` and its related logic. This includes adding an `uploadResultMap` property to track upload states, mapping complex attachment data, and rigorously testing these new functionalities.
*   **Test Refinements for ID Accuracy**: There were several rapid, consecutive changes in the test file (`journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart`) to adjust the expected `id` values in test assertions. This suggests a process of fine-tuning test cases to precisely match the actual IDs used in fixtures or returned by the mapper under various conditions, moving from placeholder IDs to concrete ones.
*   **Architectural Separation (Mapper Pattern)**: The introduction of a dedicated `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper` demonstrates a clear architectural pattern of separating domain models from UI presentation models, facilitating UI-specific transformations.
*   **TODO for Future Work**: The `_mapAttachmentLocalFile` method in the new mapper explicitly marks a "TODO - temporary implementation", highlighting an area slated for further development and improved conversion logic.
*   **Consistency in `uploadResultMap` Initialization**: The `uploadResultMap: {}` is consistently initialized as an empty map in both the fixture and the mapper, and verified in tests, indicating its importance for a new feature.
