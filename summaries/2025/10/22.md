# Activity Summary for 10/22/2025

## 12:10:49 AM
The changes log details iterative modifications to a single file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_attachment_field.dart`, over a short period.

The most significant update occurred between **10/21/2025, 11:07:25 PM** and **10/21/2025, 11:07:31 PM**. This update refined the logic within the `_addMultipleAttachments` method, specifically inside the `bloc.stream.listen` callback when handling `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted`.

**Key Change:**
Previously, at 11:07:25 PM, when an `FSFormAttachmentStateUploadAttempted` state was processed, a new map named `uploadResultMap` was created from the existing `uploadStateMap`. Then, `uploadStateMap` was updated with the new state (`uploadStateMap[state.file] = state.uploadState;`). However, the `uploadedModel` was copied using the *old* `uploadResultMap` (which was a copy before the latest state update), rather than the directly modified `uploadStateMap`.

By 11:07:31 PM, this was corrected. The redundant creation of `uploadResultMap` was removed. Instead, `uploadStateMap` is directly updated, and `uploadedModel` is then copied using this *updated* `uploadStateMap`. This ensures that the `uploadedModel` correctly reflects the current upload status of attachments.

Subsequent entries at **10/21/2025, 11:07:36 PM** and **10/21/2025, 11:08:00 PM** show no further code alterations for this file, indicating that the fix implemented around 11:07:31 PM was the final change in this sequence.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**
The log demonstrates focused work on a specific part of the attachment handling logic within a Flutter Bloc context. All changes are concentrated on ensuring the `uploadResultMap` accurately reflects the state of attachment uploads, particularly when new attachments are added or their upload status changes. The tight timestamps suggest a rapid cycle of testing and refinement for this particular piece of functionality. The use of `FSLogger.logWithTag` is consistent across all versions, indicating robust logging practices.
