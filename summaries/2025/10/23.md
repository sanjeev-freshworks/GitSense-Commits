# Activity Summary for 10/23/2025

## 12:00:36 PM
For the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/attachment/attachment_item_preview.dart`, the changes primarily involve a minor refinement to a logging statement.

This file defines the `AttachmentItemPreview` StatelessWidget, responsible for displaying a local attachment along with its upload status. It includes logic to render different UI elements (loading spinner, retry icon, close icon) based on the `AttachmentUploadState` (InProgress, Error, Success, Initial) and whether the item is editable.

On 10/23/2025 at 11:06:52 AM, an incomplete logging statement `FSLogger.logWithTag(tag, message)` was introduced within the `_buildTrailing` method. Just twenty seconds later, at 11:07:12 AM, this was corrected and made functional by specifying a tag and message: `FSLogger.logWithTag("siderfighter", "Building trailing widget - State: $uploadState");`. This indicates a quick fix to an initially added placeholder or incomplete debugging log.

The core functionality and structure of the `AttachmentItemPreview` widget, including its handling of various upload states and editable property, remained unchanged across these entries. The only alteration was this specific logging statement's completion.
