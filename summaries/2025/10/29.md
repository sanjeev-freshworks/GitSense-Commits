# Activity Summary for 10/29/2025

## 12:58:03 AM
This log primarily details updates related to attachment handling within a Flutter Freshservice application, focusing on form fields and their associated business logic. The changes span several Dart files across `form_lib`, `journey_lib`, and `common_business` libraries, with a notable period of activity on **October 28, 2025**, between 4:00 PM and 7:00 PM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/form_lib.dart`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/28/2025, 4:02:44 PM, 4:05:35 PM, 6:38:15 PM
    *   This file, serving as the `form_lib` package's main export, saw consistent updates to its export statements.
    *   Initially, it exported various `src/data/model/businessrule` and `src/data/model/form_field` related files, along with DI, domain, helper, and UI components.
    *   A significant addition around **6:38:15 PM** was the export of `src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_attachment_preview_field.dart`, indicating the introduction of a new UI component for attachment previews.

2.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/test/ui/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller_test.dart`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/28/2025, 4:04:02 PM, 4:05:04 PM, 4:06:32 PM, 4:06:38 PM, 4:06:47 PM, 4:06:52 PM, 4:07:03 PM, 4:10:42 PM, 4:10:59 PM, 4:11:06 PM, 4:11:13 PM, 4:11:21 PM
    *   This test file underwent numerous minor adjustments, predominantly in the `setUp` method of the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` group.
    *   Initially, the controller was instantiated with `mockUploadFileToItilUseCase` and `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadControllerArgs`.
    *   There were several minor refactorings of how `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadControllerArgs` were passed to the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` constructor, involving moving named arguments, adding an explicit `uploadFileToItilUseCase` named parameter, and minor type-casting adjustments (e.g., `model as FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel` and `model as FormFieldUIModel`).
    *   Around **4:10:42 PM**, `currentModel` and `emittedModels` were temporarily changed to `FormFieldUIModel` types, then reverted back to `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel` in subsequent commits, indicating debugging or experimentation with the UI model type.
    *   The core test logic for `uploadFile`, `retryUpload`, and `removeAttachment` remained consistent across these changes, verifying success, error, multiple uploads, and attachment management states (`InProgress`, `Success`, `Error`). The tests utilize Mockito for `UploadFileToItilUseCase`.

3.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/form/view/fields/form_attachment_field_item_catalog_screen.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/28/2025, 4:17:24 PM
    *   This file defines a catalog screen for an attachment field. The code remained stable, demonstrating how to use `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` with `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel`. It initializes a `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel` and manages its state (attachments, `isShowAttachmentPicker`, `attachmentExtensionConfig`) via `setState` in the `onChanged` callback.

4.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/28/2025, 4:25:49 PM, 4:25:56 PM, 4:26:51 PM, 4:32:27 PM, 4:33:16 PM, 5:26:51 PM, 5:37:54 PM, 6:39:29 PM, 6:39:39 PM, 6:39:48 PM
    *   This file, a core UI widget for ITIL attachment fields, saw several minor updates.
    *   Around **4:25:56 PM**, a comment clarifying that `FSFormFieldUIModelProvider` should be provided by the parent widget was added.
    *   Around **4:33:16 PM**, the `provider` import was changed to `flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart`, and then reverted, suggesting a reconsideration of the state management approach. Later changes (5:26:51 PM, 5:37:54 PM) show it importing `package:provider/provider.dart` again.
    *   A significant UI refactoring occurred around **6:39:29 PM**, where explicit `_buildLabel` and `_buildErrorText` methods were introduced. The `FSPlainButton` for attaching files was retained, but the overall structure was modified to include a label and error message display, improving user feedback and accessibility.

5.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/domain/usecase/upload_file_to_itil_use_case.dart`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/28/2025, 4:34:32 PM, 4:43:48 PM, 4:45:33 PM, 4:46:12 PM, 5:09:03 PM, 6:53:34 PM, 7:00:43 PM
    *   This file remained stable for a long period, with the `protectedExecute` method explicitly `throw UnimplementedError();` and a commented-out line `// return _commonLibRepository.uploadItilAttachmentFile(file: param);`.
    *   The most significant change was at **7:00:43 PM**, where the `throw UnimplementedError()` was *removed*, and the commented-out line was *uncommented*, making the use case actually call `_commonLibRepository.uploadItilAttachmentFile(file: param)`. This indicates that the file upload functionality moved from a placeholder/stub to an active implementation.

6.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/activity_form/journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/28/2025, 5:06:23 PM, 5:06:30 PM, 5:06:46 PM, 5:42:50 PM, 6:41:06 PM, 6:41:16 PM
    *   This Flutter widget, responsible for rendering activity form fields, saw a few noteworthy updates.
    *   Imports were adjusted (`journey_form_detail_ui_state_extension.dart` added around 5:06:46 PM).
    *   A new `onAttachmentPreviewClicked` callback was added to the `JourneyFormDetailActivityFormContent` widget and its state class around **5:42:50 PM**. This coincided with the addition of logic to render `FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel` using `_buildAttachmentPreviewField` within the `switch (formField)` statement, indicating support for displaying non-editable attachment previews.
    *   Brief revert-like changes related to `FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel` and `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel` in the `switch` statement (6:41:06 PM, 6:41:16 PM) suggest refinement of how these different attachment UI models are handled.

7.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/journey_form_detail_screen_root.dart`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/28/2025, 5:07:01 PM, 5:07:27 PM, 5:07:36 PM, 5:07:47 PM, 5:08:03 PM, 5:08:17 PM
    *   This root screen component for journey form details showed changes primarily around providing and consuming `FSFormFieldUIModelProvider`.
    *   Initially, it implemented `FSFormFieldUIModelProvider` and wrapped `JourneyFormDetailContent` with a `Provider.value`.
    *   Between **5:07:47 PM** and **5:08:17 PM**, the `implements FSFormFieldUIModelProvider` and the `Provider<FSFormFieldUIModelProvider>.value` wrapper were removed, indicating a change in how the `FSFormFieldUIModelProvider` functionality is exposed or utilized higher up the widget tree or via a different mechanism.

8.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/pubspec.yaml`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/28/2025, 4:27:59 PM, 4:28:06 PM, 5:27:16 PM
    *   These changes show no functional code alteration, only minor whitespace or comment-like modifications, resulting in identical file content for `pubspec.yaml` across these timestamps.

9.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/form_field_ui_model.dart`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/28/2025, 5:41:58 PM, 6:38:25 PM
    *   This file primarily manages the partial file exports for various `FormFieldUIModel` types.
    *   An update around **5:41:58 PM** added `part 'fields/form_attachment_preview_field_ui_model.dart';` and `part 'fields/form_attachment_with_upload_state_ui_model.dart';`, confirming the formal introduction of these new attachment UI models into the `form_lib` structure. The list of exported files (Text, Paragraph, Number, etc.) remained consistent otherwise.

10. **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/28/2025, 5:42:20 PM, 5:57:23 PM, 5:57:34 PM, 5:58:39 PM, 5:58:58 PM, 5:59:17 PM, 5:59:31 PM, 6:00:03 PM, 6:00:17 PM, 6:01:56 PM, 6:02:31 PM, 6:02:38 PM, 6:02:54 PM, 6:03:09 PM, 6:03:23 PM, 6:03:34 PM, 6:03:43 PM, 6:03:54 PM, 6:04:03 PM, 6:04:33 PM, 6:04:59 PM, 6:05:12 PM, 6:42:35 PM, 6:42:43 PM, 6:42:51 PM
    *   This file underwent extensive, fine-grained modifications, particularly within the `_mapAttachment` method.
    *   Initially, `_mapAttachment` determined whether to use `_journeyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper` (for editable fields) or `_journeyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper` (for non-editable fields).
    *   Between **5:57 PM and 6:05 PM**, there were multiple attempts to correctly pass `attachmentExtensionConfig` to `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapperInput`. This involved trying to extract `supportedTypes` directly from `field as FormFieldTypeAttachment`, casting it, mapping it to extensions and UTI info, and eventually simplifying to passing `List<AttachmentFieldSupportedFileTypes>? supportedTypes`. Many of these intermediate commits introduced syntax errors or incomplete logic. The final stable version in this sequence (6:05:12 PM) likely passes the `supportedTypes` directly.
    *   Later, around **6:42 PM**, another series of partial edits (marked by `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> b0b8e185ddff239f0efa2d38e8a4f557a3051d2e`) show the removal of the `_journeyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper` from both the class fields and the constructor, indicating that it might have been refactored or moved elsewhere, or its usage simplified.

11. **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/28/2025, 6:41:56 PM
    *   This test file asserts the correct mapping of activity form fields to UI models, including handling of editable vs. non-editable attachment fields. It explicitly verifies that non-editable attachments map to `FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel` and editable ones to `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel`.

12. **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/28/2025, 6:42:05 PM, 6:48:44 PM
    *   This test file specifically validates the `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper`.
    *   A significant change at **6:42:05 PM** shows that the `attachments` list for the `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel` was changed from containing actual `AttachmentLocalFile` objects (e.g., `'https://example.com/file1.pdf'`) to being an `empty list`. The comment clarifies: `// Mapper always returns empty list for attachments`. This indicates a conceptual shift where the upload model is no longer responsible for holding *pre-existing* attachments, but rather managing new uploads. The `uploadResultMap` is also confirmed to be empty. This change was preserved in the later 6:48:44 PM commit.

13. **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper.dart`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/28/2025, 6:42:22 PM
    *   This file defines the mapper for `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper`. It explicitly sets the `attachments` list to empty and `uploadResultMap` to empty, reinforcing the change seen in the corresponding test file. This mapper's role is to convert a `JourneyFormField` into a `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel`.

14. **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/di/journey_form_detail_ui_module.dart`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/28/2025, 6:39:56 PM, 6:40:09 PM
    *   This dependency injection module saw partial `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> b0b8e185ddff239f0efa2d38e8a4f557a3051d2e` merge conflict markers in its commit, specifically around the registration of `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper`. This indicates a merge conflict or incomplete change where the `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper` was both removed and potentially re-added, reflecting the uncertainty in how attachment preview mappers are being handled within the DI system.

15. **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/di/journey_lib_module_test.dart`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/28/2025, 6:41:31 PM, 6:41:39 PM, 6:41:47 PM, 6:44:47 PM
    *   Similar to the DI module, this test file also shows `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>>` markers, specifically around the import and verification of `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper`. This further highlights a problematic or unresolved state regarding this mapper's presence and registration in the DI setup. At **6:44:47 PM**, the specific tests for `JourneyFormDetailUiModule` and `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper` were removed, likely a temporary measure to resolve the merge conflict or streamline tests.

16. **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/28/2025, 6:50:02 PM, 6:50:22 PM, 6:50:40 PM, 6:50:46 PM, 6:50:58 PM, 6:51:15 PM, 6:51:21 PM, 6:51:37 PM, 6:52:12 PM, 6:52:23 PM, 6:52:29 PM, 6:52:39 PM, 6:52:47 PM
    *   This controller for ITIL attachment uploads had many rapid, small changes focused on how `UCResult` (UseCaseResult) is processed using Dart's `switch` expression with pattern matching.
    *   Early commits used `UCResultSuccess<ItilAttachment>(:final value)` and `UCResultError<ItilAttachment>(:final error)`.
    *   Multiple intermediate commits show incorrect syntax like `UCSuccessResu<ItilAttachment> success` or `UCSuccessResult( var dat: final value)`, followed by corrections to `UCSuccessResult(data: var data)` or `UCSuccessResult(data: final data)`. The changes reflect an evolution in Dart's pattern matching syntax for sealed classes or a developer refining the implementation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Attachment Feature Focus:** A dominant theme is the development and refinement of an attachment upload and preview feature, particularly for ITIL-related forms. This includes new UI models (`FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel`, `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel`), a dedicated upload controller (`FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController`), and corresponding mappers and DI registrations.
*   **Refactoring and Code Quality:** Many changes, especially in test files and controller implementations, involve minor refactorings, syntax adjustments (like Dart's `switch` expressions), and clarification of comments. This indicates an ongoing effort to improve code clarity, maintainability, and correct implementation details.
*   **State Management and Dependency Injection:** There's a clear pattern of using `Provider` for `FSFormFieldUIModelProvider` and `fsDIComponent` for dependency injection. The repeated adjustments around `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper` in DI configuration and tests suggest some churn or challenge in integrating this specific component into the existing DI structure.
*   **UI Component Enhancements:** The addition of `_buildLabel` and `_buildErrorText` in `fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart` shows an emphasis on improving the user interface and feedback mechanisms for form fields.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** The `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` heavily uses `Future`, `async`, `CancelableOperation`, and `FSMutex` to handle parallel file uploads and ensure thread safety, indicating complex asynchronous operations are at play.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The close timestamps and frequent, small changes, particularly in the `fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller_test.dart` and `journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart` files, suggest rapid development and iterative refinement of these features.
*   **Stub Replacement:** The most impactful functional change is the activation of the `UploadFileToItilUseCase` by replacing `throw UnimplementedError()` with the actual repository call, indicating a transition from mock/stub implementation to real functionality.

## 3:44:35 AM
The provided log details a series of changes primarily focused on enhancing and stabilizing the attachment handling functionality within a Flutter application, particularly for form fields in the `form_lib` and `journey_lib` libraries.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/form_lib.dart`**:
    *   Initially served as a central export file for various form-related models, business rules, use cases, and UI components.
    *   A significant addition was the export of `src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_attachment_preview_field.dart` around 6:38:15 PM, indicating the introduction of a dedicated UI component for displaying attachment previews.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/test/ui/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller_test.dart`**:
    *   This test file for `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` underwent several iterative changes.
    *   Early changes (around 4:06 PM) involved refactoring the controller's constructor arguments, initially removing then re-adding `fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller_args.dart`.
    *   A notable generalization occurred at 4:10:42 PM, where `currentModel` and `emittedModels` types were changed from specific `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel` to the more generic `FormFieldUIModel`, suggesting increased flexibility in the controller's model handling.
    *   Further minor adjustments to the `onModelChanged` callback's casting logic were observed between 4:10 PM and 4:11 PM.
    *   Later changes (around 6:41 PM) indicate the `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper` was integrated into the Dependency Injection (DI) tests for `JourneyFormDetailUiModule`, solidifying its role in the architecture. It also revealed a temporary divergence in how attachment lists were handled in mapper tests, which was quickly corrected back to an empty list for the upload model.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/form/view/fields/form_attachment_field_item_catalog_screen.dart`**:
    *   This file, updated at 4:17:24 PM, demonstrates the usage of the `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` within a catalog screen. It manages the `isShowAttachmentPicker`, `attachments`, and `attachmentExtensionConfig` states to showcase the attachment field's functionality.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`**:
    *   Defines the `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` widget, a core component for ITIL attachment handling.
    *   Minor documentation refinement at 4:25:56 PM.
    *   Experienced a brief dependency change from `provider` to `flutter_bloc` and then a quick reversion back to `provider` around 4:32 PM - 5:26 PM, suggesting `FSFormFieldUIModelProvider` is firmly managed by the `provider` package.
    *   Significant UI enhancements at 6:39 PM introduced explicit rendering of the field's label and error messages using `FormFieldUIUtil` helper methods, standardizing the field's presentation.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/pubspec.yaml`**:
    *   Updated at 4:27:59 PM to include `fs_logger: '1.0.0'` in dependencies, indicating increased logging capabilities for the form library.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/domain/usecase/upload_file_to_itil_use_case.dart`**:
    *   Most notably, at 7:00:43 PM, the `protectedExecute` method was fully implemented to call `_commonLibRepository.uploadItilAttachmentFile`, removing the `UnimplementedError()` placeholder. This signifies the activation and functional completion of the ITIL attachment upload logic.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/activity_form/journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart`**:
    *   Expanded its capabilities around 5:42:50 PM by adding an `onAttachmentPreviewClicked` callback and incorporating `_buildAttachmentPreviewField` to handle `FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel`. This enhances the ability to display and interact with both editable and read-only attachment fields.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/journey_form_detail_screen_root.dart`**:
    *   Underwent refactoring to its `FSFormFieldUIModelProvider` implementation between 5:07 PM and 5:08 PM. The root screen stopped directly implementing and providing `FSFormFieldUIModelProvider`, suggesting this responsibility was either moved higher up in the widget tree or handled differently. Related imports were also adjusted.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/form_field_ui_model.dart`**:
    *   At 5:41:58 PM, new part files were added for `form_attachment_preview_field_ui_model.dart` and `form_attachment_with_upload_state_ui_model.dart`, formally introducing these UI models into the form library.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart`**:
    *   This mapper was repeatedly modified between 5:42 PM and 6:05 PM, mainly focusing on how attachment fields are processed. It now correctly distinguishes between editable and non-editable attachment fields, mapping them to `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel` and `FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel` respectively. There were multiple attempts and corrections to extract and pass `AttachmentExtensionConfigWithUTIInfo` correctly, eventually simplifying the logic by handling supported types directly. Its dependencies on `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper` and `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper` were confirmed through DI setup.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper.dart`**:
    *   Updated at 6:42:22 PM to explicitly return an empty list for `attachments` and an empty map for `uploadResultMap`. This clarifies that this mapper's role is to create the initial UI model for an attachment field, not to pre-populate it with existing attachments or their upload states.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`**:
    *   This controller, added around 6:50:02 PM, handles the core logic for ITIL attachment uploads, including parallel processing, cancellation of ongoing uploads, retries, and removal. It uses a `FSMutex` for thread-safe model updates.
    *   Between 6:50 PM and 6:52 PM, the `switch` statement for handling `UCResult` was iteratively refined to adopt the Dart 3 pattern matching syntax, going through several corrections of syntax and variable names (`UCSuccessResu`, `fina data`, `final excepti`) before settling on the correct pattern `UCSuccessResult(data: final data)` and `UCErrorResult(exception: final exception)`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/di/journey_form_detail_ui_module.dart`**:
    *   The Dependency Injection module for journey form details was updated around 6:39 PM - 6:40 PM, cleaning up Git merge conflicts. It now correctly registers `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper`, `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper`, `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper`, and `JourneyActivityFormValidator`, ensuring all attachment-related mappers and validators are available.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on Attachment Management:** The overwhelming majority of changes revolve around the implementation, testing, and integration of a robust attachment upload and display system. This includes specific UI components, controllers, mappers, and domain logic for handling attachments in various states (uploading, success, error, preview).
*   **Layered Architecture (UI, Presentation, Domain, Data):** The changes demonstrate a clear separation of concerns, with distinct components for UI (`fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`), presentation logic (`fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`, mappers), and domain logic (`upload_file_to_itil_use_case.dart`).
*   **Iterative Refinement and Correction:** Several files show multiple commits addressing small syntax errors, typos, or incomplete code blocks (e.g., in `fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart` and `journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart`), often indicated by Git conflict markers. This highlights an iterative development process with frequent commits.
*   **Dependency Injection (DI) usage:** The `fsDIComponent` is consistently used across multiple libraries (`form_lib`, `journey_lib`) to register and retrieve dependencies, enforcing a modular and testable architecture.
*   **Flutter-specific patterns:** Use of `StatefulWidget`, `State`, `initState`, `dispose`, `Provider`, `context.read`, `BuildContext`, and UI components like `Column`, `SizedBox`, `FSPlainButton` are prevalent, indicating standard Flutter development practices.
*   **Timestamp Consistency:** All changes occurred on the same date, "10/28/2025", within a span of a few hours. This suggests a focused development effort or a series of closely related tasks being completed and committed.

## 8:50:23 AM
The changes primarily focus on enhancing form functionality, particularly around attachment handling, within a Flutter project utilizing `form_lib` and `journey_lib`.

    *   **10/28/2025, 4:02:44 PM - 4:05:35 PM**: Initial exports for a wide range of form-related models, business rules, and UI components.
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:38:15 PM**: Added a new export for `fs_form_attachment_preview_field.dart`, indicating the introduction of a new UI component for displaying attachment previews.
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:39:29 PM**: The `fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart` was updated to include dedicated UI elements for labels and error messages (`_buildLabel`, `_buildErrorText`) and adjusted spacing, significantly improving the user experience for attachment fields.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/test/ui/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller_test.dart**
    *   **10/28/2025, 4:04:02 PM - 4:07:03 PM**: Tests for `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` were established, covering single/multiple attachment uploads (success/error), retries, and removals. There were several minor syntax fixes and attempts to refactor the controller's constructor arguments, which eventually reverted to using an `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadControllerArgs` object.
    *   **10/28/2025, 4:10:42 PM - 4:11:21 PM**: The type of models (`currentModel`, `emittedModels`) in the test setup was generalized from `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel` to `FormFieldUIModel`, followed by a series of syntax corrections for type casting within the `onModelChanged` callback.
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:41:31 PM - 6:42:51 PM**: This period involved a back-and-forth with merge conflicts (indicated by `<<<<<<< HEAD` markers) concerning the inclusion and usage of `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper` in `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper`'s dependencies, which was ultimately resolved to include it.
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:44:47 PM**: The dependency injection (DI) tests were significantly reduced, removing many specific mapper and validator checks, possibly for a temporary simplification during development.
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:41:56 PM - 6:48:44 PM**: Tests for `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper` and `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper` were updated. A key clarification emerged: the `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper` is designed to return an *empty* list for attachments, as its purpose is to handle *new uploads* rather than pre-existing ones.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/form/view/fields/form_attachment_field_item_catalog_screen.dart**
    *   **10/28/2025, 4:17:24 PM**: A new screen was added to demonstrate the `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` widget, showcasing how to manage its state and attachment picker behavior.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart**

    *   **10/28/2025, 6:39:29 PM**: Integrated UI for labels and error messages (as noted for `form_lib.dart` above).

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/pubspec.yaml**
    *   **10/28/2025, 4:27:59 PM - 5:27:16 PM**: No functional changes observed, consistent dependency declarations for `flutter_bloc` and `provider`.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/domain/usecase/upload_file_to_itil_use_case.dart**
    *   **10/28/2025, 4:34:32 PM - 6:53:34 PM**: The `UploadFileToItilUseCase` initially had a placeholder `throw UnimplementedError()` in its `protectedExecute` method.
    *   **10/28/2025, 7:00:43 PM**: This use case was fully implemented by uncommenting the call to `_commonLibRepository.uploadItilAttachmentFile` and removing the `UnimplementedError` and artificial delay, making the attachment upload functional.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/activity_form/journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart**

    *   **10/28/2025, 6:41:06 PM - 6:41:16 PM**: Resolved merge conflicts around the `switch` statement that handles different form field types, ensuring `FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel` is correctly processed.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/journey_form_detail_screen_root.dart**
    *   **10/28/2025, 5:07:01 PM - 5:08:17 PM**: `JourneyFormDetailScreenRoot` was introduced to manage the root display of journey form details. Initially, it implemented `FSFormFieldUIModelProvider` and wrapped content with `Provider.value`. Subsequent changes removed the `Provider.value` wrapper and then the `implements FSFormFieldUIModelProvider` declaration, suggesting a re-evaluation of where this provider is exposed or how it's accessed in the widget tree. Also, the `form_lib` import was removed.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/form_field_ui_model.dart**
    *   **10/28/2025, 5:41:58 PM**: New UI model types `form_attachment_preview_field_ui_model.dart` and `form_attachment_with_upload_state_ui_model.dart` were introduced, formalizing the different states/purposes of attachment fields in the UI.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart**
    *   **10/28/2025, 5:42:20 PM**: Implementation of `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper`, which maps domain `JourneyFormField`s to UI models. It uses distinct mappers for editable attachments (`_journeyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper`) and non-editable attachment previews (`_journeyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper`).
    *   **10/28/2025, 5:57:34 PM - 6:05:12 PM**: This file saw a series of complex and often conflicting changes related to how `attachmentExtensionConfig` (or `supportedTypes`) is extracted from `FormFieldTypeAttachment` and passed to the `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapperInput`. Multiple attempts were made to correctly handle the type casting and data extraction, with intermittent syntax errors and partial reverts, eventually settling on a consistent approach.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/di/journey_form_detail_ui_module.dart**
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:39:56 PM - 6:40:09 PM**: Resolved merge conflicts related to the registration and dependencies of `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper`, ensuring it is correctly provided in the DI graph for `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper`.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper.dart**
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:42:22 PM**: The `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapperInput` was updated to explicitly accept `AttachmentExtensionConfigWithUTIInfo? attachmentExtensionConfig`, and this configuration is now directly passed to the `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel` it creates.

*   **/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart**
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:50:02 PM**: Initial implementation of `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` for managing ITIL attachment uploads. It uses `CancelableOperation` for parallel uploads, `FSMutex` for thread-safe model updates, and manages `InProgress`, `Success`, and `Error` states for attachments. It handles `uploadFile`, `retryUpload`, and `removeAttachment` logic, including cancellation of ongoing uploads.
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:50:22 PM - 6:52:47 PM**: Multiple small commits fixing and refining the `switch` statement logic for processing `UCResult<ItilAttachment>` into `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess` or `AttachmentUploadStateError` within the `_uploadFilesParallely` method. These were primarily syntax corrections and pattern matching refinements for sealed classes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Attachment Feature Development**: A strong pattern of focused development on attachment fields is evident. This includes creating new UI models (`FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel`, `FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel`), dedicated UI widgets (`fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`, `fs_form_attachment_preview_field.dart`), and associated logic (controllers, mappers) for handling file uploads, previews, and managing their state.
*   **Refinement and Bug Fixing**: Many consecutive commits address minor syntax errors, type casting issues, or logical inconsistencies (e.g., in `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper` and `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController`), indicating an iterative development and testing process.
*   **Dependency Management**: The project heavily relies on dependency injection (`fsDIComponent`) and state management libraries (`provider`, `flutter_bloc`). There were instances of switching between `provider` and `flutter_bloc` imports, suggesting an ongoing decision or refactoring of state management strategy.
*   **Clear Separation of Concerns**: The naming conventions (e.g., `_uploadFileToItilUseCase`, `_commonFormFieldUIMapper`) and file structure suggest a layered architecture with clear separation between UI, presentation (controllers, mappers), domain (use cases), and data components.
*   **Asynchronous Operations Handling**: The `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` demonstrates robust asynchronous programming patterns, using `CancelableOperation` and `FSMutex` to manage potentially long-running and concurrent file uploads safely.
*   **UI Polish**: The addition of label and error message rendering for attachment fields indicates a focus on improving the user interface and feedback mechanisms.
*   **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Several entries show merge conflict markers, which were subsequently resolved in very short timeframes, indicating active collaboration and frequent code merges.

## 10:50:49 AM
The code changes primarily revolve around implementing and refining attachment handling functionality within the Freshservice mobile Flutter application. The updates occurred on October 28, 2025, over approximately three hours, indicating a concentrated development effort.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/form_lib.dart` (Timestamps: 4:02:44 PM, 4:05:35 PM, 6:38:15 PM)**
    *   Initially (4:02 PM), this library export file exposed numerous form field models, business rule components, and UI elements, including `fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`.
    *   A significant update at 6:38:15 PM introduced the export for a new UI component: `src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_attachment_preview_field.dart`, suggesting new functionality for displaying non-editable attachments.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/test/ui/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller_test.dart` (Timestamps: 4:04:02 PM - 4:11:21 PM)**
    *   This file, a unit test for `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController`, underwent frequent and iterative changes.
    *   The primary focus was on testing `uploadFile` (for single/multiple attachments, success/error, and retry logic), `retryUpload`, and `removeAttachment` functionalities.
    *   A recurring pattern in this file was the rapid, small refactorings and corrections to the `setUp` method, particularly concerning the initialization of `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` and the type casting within its `onModelChanged` callback. This suggests the developer was actively debugging and stabilizing the controller's initialization and state management interactions during this period.
    *   A temporary change in `currentModel` type from `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel` to `FormFieldUIModel` (4:10:42 PM) was quickly reverted, indicating experimentation with broader type compatibility, which was then narrowed back to the specific attachment model.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/lib/src/components/form/view/fields/form_attachment_field_item_catalog_screen.dart` (Timestamp: 4:17:24 PM)**
    *   This file introduced a UI catalog screen to showcase the `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField`. It demonstrates how the attachment field can be initialized and how its state (attachment picker visibility, actual attachments, and configuration) is managed and updated.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart` (Timestamps: 4:25:49 PM - 6:39:48 PM)**
    *   This file defines the `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` widget, a key UI component for attachment management.
    *   It integrates with `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` via dependency injection.
    *   Notable changes include:
        *   An initial explicit dependency on the `provider` package for `FSFormFieldUIModelProvider`, which was temporarily switched to `flutter_bloc`'s `context.read` at 4:33:16 PM, then reverted back to `provider` at 5:26:51 PM, highlighting a brief architectural decision change.
        *   Significant UI enhancements at 6:39:29 PM, adding dedicated widgets for displaying the field's label and error messages using `FormFieldUIUtil`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/pubspec.yaml` (Timestamps: 4:27:59 PM, 4:28:06 PM, 5:27:16 PM)**
    *   This file consistently lists standard Flutter and Freshservice internal library dependencies, showing no functional changes during this log, only being recorded.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/domain/usecase/upload_file_to_itil_use_case.dart` (Timestamps: 4:34:32 PM - 7:00:43 PM)**
    *   Initially (4:34 PM), this `UseCase` was a placeholder, throwing `UnimplementedError()` after a delay.
    *   The crucial change occurred at 7:00:43 PM, where the `protectedExecute` method was fully implemented to directly call `_commonLibRepository.uploadItilAttachmentFile(file: param);`, making the attachment upload functionality operational.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/activity_form/journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart` (Timestamps: 5:06:23 PM - 6:41:16 PM)**
    *   This widget displays activity form fields.
    *   Early changes included adding necessary `flutter_bloc` and extension imports.
    *   A significant update at 5:42:50 PM introduced support for displaying attachment preview fields (`FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel`) by adding a new `onAttachmentPreviewClicked` callback and a `_buildAttachmentPreviewField` function, alongside the existing `_buildAttachmentField` for uploadable attachments. This solidifies the distinction between editable and preview-only attachment fields in the UI.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/journey_form_detail_screen_root.dart` (Timestamps: 5:07:01 PM - 5:08:17 PM)**
    *   This root screen initially implemented `FSFormFieldUIModelProvider` and provided it to its children.
    *   However, between 5:07:27 PM and 5:07:47 PM, the `FSFormFieldUIModelProvider` implementation and the associated `Provider.value` wrapper were removed. Imports related to `form_lib` were also removed at 5:08:03 PM, indicating a shift in responsibility for `FSFormFieldUIModelProvider` further down the widget tree, likely to the `JourneyFormDetailContent` or a more specific child.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/form_field_ui_model.dart` (Timestamps: 5:41:58 PM, 6:38:25 PM)**
    *   This file was updated at 5:41:58 PM to `part` in two new UI model definitions: `form_attachment_preview_field_ui_model.dart` and `form_attachment_with_upload_state_ui_model.dart`. This is a foundational change for handling the different states and interactions of attachment fields.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart` (Timestamps: 5:42:20 PM - 6:05:12 PM)**
    *   This mapper translates journey form fields into UI models.
    *   It underwent a series of intricate, often incomplete, and reverted changes regarding how `attachmentExtensionConfig` (and its underlying type `AttachmentFieldSupportedFileTypes`) is handled and passed during the mapping of `FormFieldTypeAttachment`. This highlights the complexity of correctly propagating configuration details for file attachments. The process stabilized around 6:04 PM to correctly extract and pass `supportedTypes` from the `JourneyFormField`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/di/journey_form_detail_ui_module.dart` (Timestamps: 6:39:56 PM, 6:40:09 PM)**
    *   This DI module registered various mappers, use cases, and validators for the journey form detail.
    *   The primary change was the resolution of a merge conflict at 6:40:09 PM, ensuring correct registration of `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/di/journey_lib_module_test.dart` (Timestamps: 6:41:31 PM - 6:44:47 PM)**
    *   Initial state (6:41 PM) showed DI tests with a merge conflict, which was resolved.
    *   A notable change at 6:44:47 PM involved the *removal* of all DI tests for `JourneyFormDetailUiModule`, indicating a potential restructuring of test strategy or a temporary cleanup.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart` (Timestamp: 6:41:56 PM)**
    *   This new test file validates the `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper`. Crucially, it confirms that the mapper correctly distinguishes between editable attachment fields (mapping to `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel`) and non-editable ones (mapping to `FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel`), a key logic for the new attachment features.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart` (Timestamps: 6:42:05 PM, 6:48:44 PM)**
    *   This new test file focuses on `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper`.
    *   An initial merge conflict around `result.attachments` (6:42:05 PM) was resolved at 6:48:44 PM by confirming that the mapper returns an *empty list* for attachments. This reinforces that this mapper is specifically for the *upload state* UI model, which doesn't contain already uploaded files.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper.dart` (Timestamp: 6:42:22 PM)**
    *   This new mapper is responsible for creating `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel` instances. It explicitly sets the `attachments` list and `uploadResultMap` to be empty, aligning with its role in handling *new* attachments for upload.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart` (Timestamps: 6:50:02 PM - 6:52:47 PM)**
    *   This new controller manages the complex logic of ITIL attachment uploads.
    *   It uses `CancelableOperation` for handling concurrent uploads and enabling cancellation.
    *   It employs `FSMutex` for thread-safe model updates.
    *   The `uploadFile` method updates the UI model immediately with "in progress" states for new attachments and subsequently with success or error states.
    *   The implementation of `switch (result)` for handling `UCResult` (success/error outcomes) evolved rapidly in this log, demonstrating the adoption and refinement of modern Dart pattern matching for result handling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Attachment Feature Development:** The most prominent pattern is the end-to-end development of an attachment feature. This includes:
    *   New UI models (`FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel`, `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel`).
    *   Dedicated UI widgets (`FSFormItemItilAttachmentField`, `FSFormAttachmentPreviewField`).
    *   A new controller (`FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController`) with complex async logic, cancellation, and thread-safe updates.
    *   Specialized mappers (`JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper`, `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper`) to convert data models to the new UI models, distinguishing between editable and preview states.
    *   An underlying use case (`UploadFileToItilUseCase`) moving from a placeholder to a fully functional implementation.
    *   Integration into larger form structures (`JourneyFormDetailActivityFormContent`).
*   **Iterative Refinement and Corrections:** Many files show multiple, closely-timed commits with minor syntax fixes, type adjustments, and reworkings of logic (especially in mappers and controller result handling). This indicates an active and iterative development process, possibly with frequent testing and immediate corrections.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The consistent use of `fs_lib` for libraries and separate `apps` demonstrates a well-structured modular architecture, allowing for focused development on specific features (like `form_lib` and `journey_lib`).
*   **State Management Evolution:** The brief back-and-forth between `provider` and `flutter_bloc` for `FSFormFieldUIModelProvider` suggests an ongoing evaluation or adaptation of state management strategies within parts of the application.
*   **Dependency Injection (`fsDIComponent`):** The widespread use of `fsDIComponent.get` and `registerFactory` across different modules (e.g., `journey_form_detail_ui_module.dart`) is a consistent pattern for managing dependencies and promotes testability and modularity.

## 11:51:30 AM
The provided log details a series of iterative changes focusing primarily on enhancing attachment handling and UI form components within a Flutter application. Key updates include:

*   **Journey Form Detail Screen (`journey_form_detail_screen_root.dart`):** Early changes introduced a `PopScope` for better back navigation control and a `FSBlockingProgressIndicator` for blocking progress visuals. A minor `_tag` constant was added and then reverted.

*   **ITIL File Upload Use Case (`upload_file_to_itil_use_case.dart`):** This use case transitioned from a placeholder `UnimplementedError` to a fully functional implementation by integrating with `_commonLibRepository.uploadItilAttachmentFile`, enabling actual file uploads.

*   **ITIL Attachment Field UI (`fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`):** The UI for displaying ITIL attachment fields was significantly improved. It now includes dedicated rendering for field labels and error messages using `FormFieldUIUtil`. This involved refactoring the widget's `build` method and introducing helper functions for a more consistent presentation.

*   **Form Field UI Model (`form_field_ui_model.dart`):** A new UI model, `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel`, was introduced to manage attachments along with their upload status, reflecting a more comprehensive approach to attachment handling.

*   **Journey Activity Form Field Mapper (`journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart`):** This mapper underwent numerous adjustments to correctly process and map attachment-related configurations (`AttachmentExtensionConfigWithUTIInfo`, `AttachmentFieldSupportedFileTypes`). Critically, it was updated to correctly map attachment fields even when nested within custom `JourneySection` fields. Many commits in this file relate to fixing syntax and type handling during this integration.

*   **Journey Form Detail Activity Form Content (`journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart`):** The rendering strategy for form fields was refactored. The component moved away from handling attachment field rendering internally and delegated this responsibility to a newly introduced, more granular widget (`FSJourneyFormField`), simplifying its own `build` method and improving modularity.

*   **Dependency Injection Configuration (`journey_form_detail_ui_module.dart`, `journey_lib_module_test.dart`):** Dependency injection setup and corresponding tests were frequently updated to ensure that new mappers, validators (like `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateFieldValidator`), and other components were correctly registered and resolvable within the application's DI framework. There were temporary test removals and re-additions, likely due to merge conflict resolutions.

*   **ITIL Attachment Upload Controller (`fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`):** A sophisticated controller was implemented for managing attachment uploads. It supports parallel uploads, cancellation of ongoing operations, retries for failed uploads, and ensures thread-safe updates to the UI model using `FSMutex` and `CancelableOperation`. This file also shows several minor commits focused on refining Dart 3's `switch` expression pattern matching syntax for handling `UCResult` outcomes.

*   **Modular Form Field (`fs_journey_form_field.dart` - new file):** A new `StatelessWidget`, `FSJourneyFormField`, was created to centralize the rendering logic for individual form fields, including specific implementations for attachment preview and upload fields. Its development involved multiple iterations to correctly receive and propagate value change and attachment preview callbacks, making it a reusable component for various form field types.

*   **Journey Form Section Field (`fs_journey_form_section_field.dart`):** This component was refactored to leverage the new `FSJourneyFormField` for rendering its child fields. This change streamlines the section's `build` method and ensures consistent handling of individual fields by delegating their rendering to the specialized `FSJourneyFormField`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
*   **October 28, 2025, 7:00:43 PM**: Marked the full implementation of ITIL file upload.
*   **October 28, 2025, ~6:50 PM - 6:52 PM**: Focused on implementing and refining the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` for robust attachment uploads.
*   **October 29, 2025, 11:03:36 AM**: Enhanced `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper` to correctly map nested attachment fields within custom sections.
*   **October 29, 2025, ~11:35 AM - 11:45 AM**: Dedicated to the development and stabilization of the new `FSJourneyFormField` widget and its integration into section fields.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**
The most prominent pattern is the **extensive focus on attachment handling**. This includes new UI models, dedicated mappers, a robust upload controller with concurrency features, and specialized UI widgets for rendering different attachment states (preview vs. upload). There is a clear push towards **modularization and separation of concerns** in UI components, as evidenced by the introduction and integration of `FSJourneyFormField`. Frequent **merge conflict resolutions** are apparent across many files, indicating a period of active concurrent development. Finally, several commits demonstrate the adoption and **refinement of Dart 3's pattern matching syntax**.

## 12:51:12 PM
The provided log details a series of changes primarily focused on enhancing and refining form field handling, especially for attachment types, within a Flutter application's "Journey" and "Form" libraries.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/activity_form/journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart`**
    *   **10/28/2025, 5:42:50 PM**: Initial implementation showing direct handling of `FormSectionFieldUIModel`, `FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel`, and `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel` within a `switch` statement for building widgets. It manages global keys for scrolling to specific form fields and implements an `FSFormFieldUIModelProvider`.
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:41:06 PM - 6:41:16 PM**: Involved merge conflict resolution related to how attachment field types were conditionally built. The `_buildLabel` and `_buildErrorText` methods were moved or restored.
    *   **10/29/2025, 11:46:20 AM - 11:51:28 AM**: Major refactoring occurred where the direct handling of `FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel` and `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel` within the `switch` statement was removed. Instead, a new widget `FSJourneyFormField` was introduced (and its import added), becoming the primary way to render these field types, including common fields, via `_buildJourneyCommonField`. This simplifies the `journey_form_detail_activity_form_content`'s `build` method significantly by delegating complex field rendering.

*   **`/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart`**
    *   **10/28/2025, 5:57:23 PM**: `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper` maps `JourneyFormField` types to UI models. The `_mapAttachment` method initially determined if an attachment field was editable to map it to either an uploadable or preview UI model.
    *   **10/28/2025, 5:57:34 PM - 6:05:12 PM**: A series of iterative and sometimes erroneous changes were made to correctly pass `attachmentExtensionConfig` (derived from `FormFieldTypeAttachment`'s `supportedTypes`) to `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapperInput`. This included attempts to create `AttachmentExtensionConfigWithUTIInfo` and type parameter changes, indicating active development and debugging of attachment type configuration.
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:42:35 PM - 6:42:51 PM**: Minor merge conflicts related to the inclusion of `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper` in the constructor were resolved.
    *   **10/29/2025, 11:03:36 AM**: The `_mapCustomField` method was extended to recursively map `FormFieldTypeAttachment` instances found within `JourneySection` data, indicating support for nested attachment fields.

*   **`/form_lib/lib/form_lib.dart`**
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:38:15 PM**: Exports for `attachment_field_supported_file_types.dart` and `form_item_attachment_with_upload_state_field_validator.dart` were added, making new attachment-related data models and validators accessible.

*   **`/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/form_field_ui_model.dart`**
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:38:25 PM**: `form_attachment_preview_field_ui_model.dart` and `form_attachment_with_upload_state_ui_model.dart` were added as part files, meaning their definitions are now logically grouped under `form_field_ui_model.dart`.

*   **`/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`**
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:39:29 PM - 6:39:48 PM**: Resolved merge conflicts that affected the structure of the `build` method and the placement of helper functions `_buildLabel` and `_buildErrorText`.

*   **`/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/di/journey_form_detail_ui_module.dart`**
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:39:56 PM - 6:40:09 PM**: Showed merge conflict resolution where `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper` registration was temporarily impacted but then restored.

*   **`/journey_lib/test/di/journey_lib_module_test.dart`**
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:41:31 PM - 6:41:47 PM**: Repeated merge conflict resolution that temporarily removed and then re-added DI registration checks for `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper`.
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:44:47 PM**: `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper` related checks were permanently removed from this specific test file, suggesting a change in test scope or DI verification strategy for this component.

*   **`/journey_lib/test/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart`**
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:41:56 PM**: Initial tests covered mapping of various form fields, including editable and non-editable attachments.
    *   **10/29/2025, 11:06:31 AM - 11:07:45 AM**: Significant expansion of test cases to include complex scenarios: mapping custom fields with `JourneySection`, handling mixed field types, verifying nested attachment fields within sections, and filtering out unmappable field UI models. Imports for `JourneyFormField`, `JourneySection`, and `FormSectionFieldUIModel` were added. There was a minor temporary change and revert regarding test data (`unknown_data_type` vs `FormFieldTypeCustomDataPlaceholder`).

*   **`/journey_lib/test/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart`**
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:42:05 PM**: A change in expectation for `attachments` from always being an empty list to containing specific mock data, implying a temporary change in the mapper's expected behavior.
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:48:44 PM**: This change was reverted, confirming that the mapper for "attachment with upload state" should indeed return an empty list for `attachments` as it's intended for new uploads rather than existing ones.

*   **`/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper.dart`**
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:42:22 PM**: A new `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapperInput` class was introduced, formalizing the mapper's input. Crucially, the mapper explicitly initializes the `attachments` list as empty for `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel`, with a comment clarifying it's for "pending items" and "won't receive any attachments" initially. This aligns with the test revert.

*   **`/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`**
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:50:02 PM**: Introduced the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` for handling parallel attachment uploads with cancellation support and thread-safe model updates using an `FSMutex`. It tracks `_ongoingUploads` using `CancelableOperation`.
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:50:22 PM - 6:52:47 PM**: Multiple small changes and corrections were made to the `switch` statement that processes `UCResult<ItilAttachment>`, refining the pattern matching for `UCSuccessResult` and `UCErrorResult` to accurately extract `data` or `exception` for updating attachment upload states.

*   **`/common_business/lib/src/domain/usecase/upload_file_to_itil_use_case.dart`**
    *   **10/28/2025, 6:53:34 PM**: Initially, the `protectedExecute` method contained placeholder logic (delay and `UnimplementedError`).
    *   **10/28/2025, 7:00:43 PM**: This method was updated to call the actual repository method `_commonLibRepository.uploadItilAttachmentFile(file: param);`, activating the real file upload functionality.

*   **`/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form/section/field/fs_journey_form_field.dart`**
    *   **10/29/2025, 11:35:10 AM - 11:45:54 AM**: This file was created and underwent rapid development. It began as a basic `StatelessWidget`, then evolved to accept `FormFieldUIModel`, `onChanged`, and `onAttachmentPreviewClicked`. It includes a `switch` statement to delegate rendering of `FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel`, `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel` (via `_buildAttachmentWithUploadStateField`), and other fields (via `FSFormCommonField`), centralizing the display logic for various journey form fields. Initial attempts to manage nested field updates within its `onChanged` were present but later simplified or removed, indicating a clearer separation of concerns.

*   **`/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form/section/field/fs_journey_form_section_field.dart`**
    *   **10/29/2025, 11:38:01 AM - 12:04:06 PM**: This field was refactored to delegate the rendering of individual child fields to the new `FSJourneyFormField` widget. It handles initialization and management of `GlobalKey`s for scrolling within its section, and passes down its `onChanged` and `onAttachmentPreviewClicked` callbacks. It specifically delegates to `FSJourneyFormField` for building each child field within the section, including attachments.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Attachment Field Feature Development**: A major focus is the complete lifecycle of attachment fields, from mapping backend data to UI models, handling upload states (in-progress, success, error), enabling preview, and integrating into nested form structures.
2.  **Modularization and Delegation**: There's a clear move towards a more modular UI architecture.
    *   `journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart` now delegates common field rendering to `FSJourneyFormField`.
    *   `fs_journey_form_section_field.dart` also delegates its child field rendering to `FSJourneyFormField`.
    *   `FSJourneyFormField` itself then dispatches to specific builders for attachment types or `FSFormCommonField`. This reduces complexity in parent widgets and centralizes rendering logic.
3.  **Dependency Injection (DI) Management**: The DI module and its tests (`journey_form_detail_ui_module.dart`, `journey_lib_module_test.dart`) frequently appear, indicating careful management and verification of dependencies, especially during the integration of new mappers like `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper`.
4.  **Robust Upload Control**: The `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` introduces advanced features like parallel uploads, cancellation, and thread-safe model updates using `FSMutex`, signifying a commitment to a robust and responsive attachment upload experience.
5.  **Iterative Development and Refinement**: Many files show rapid, small changes, including incomplete code, comments, and temporary reverts (especially in mappers and the newly created `FSJourneyFormField` widget). This indicates an agile development process with frequent commits to refine implementation details.
6.  **Merge Conflicts**: The frequent `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>>` markers suggest active concurrent development on different branches, leading to periodic merge operations and conflict resolutions across multiple files.
7.  **Testing for Complexity**: The expanded test cases for `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper` highlight the increasing complexity of form structures, particularly with custom sections and nested fields, requiring thorough validation.

In summary, the changes reflect a significant effort to build a robust and modular form system, with a strong emphasis on handling file attachments, especially in the context of "Journey" specific forms. This involved refining data mapping, UI rendering delegation, and implementing advanced upload control mechanisms.

    *   **10/29/2025, 1:49:16 PM - 1:49:52 PM**: No content changes were recorded across these timestamps.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Attachment Handling Refinement**: A dominant theme is the extensive work on attachment-related form fields. This involved creating specific UI models (`FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel`, `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel`), updating mappers to convert data to these models, and developing dedicated UI widgets for rendering and managing attachment uploads and previews (`FSFormItemItilAttachmentField`, `FSFormAttachmentPreviewField`, and their integration into `FSJourneyFormField`). The evolution of `UploadFileToItilUseCase` from a placeholder to a functional implementation underpins this feature.
*   **Architectural Refactoring (Delegation)**: There's a clear pattern of delegating form field rendering. Initial widget implementations often used large `switch` statements to handle various `FormFieldUIModel` types directly. This logic was then extracted into smaller, reusable widgets like `FSJourneyFormField`, which then handles the `switch` internally, simplifying the parent components (`JourneyFormDetailActivityFormContent`, `FSJourneyFormSectionField`).
*   **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Several files show artifacts of merge conflicts (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `>>>>>>> ...`), indicating active concurrent development that needed to be integrated. This often led to temporary broken states, syntax errors, or commented-out code before a unified version was committed.
*   **Iterative Development and Bug Fixes**: The changes demonstrate an iterative development process, with numerous small adjustments, typo corrections, and logical refinements occurring in quick succession, especially evident in the `journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart` and `fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart` files.
*   **Dependency Injection Updates**: The DI configurations were consistently updated to reflect changes in class structure and dependencies, particularly for the attachment mappers and related use cases.
*   **Enhanced Testing**: New test cases were introduced to ensure the correct behavior of the updated mappers, reflecting a focus on robust testing for new features.

## 2:51:13 PM
Between October 28th and October 29th, 2025, the codebase saw concentrated development across several Freshservice Flutter libraries, particularly focusing on form handling, attachment uploads, and the initial setup of a search functionality, alongside the introduction of AI assistant guidelines.

**Key Changes by File:**

*   **`/journey_lib/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart` (Oct 28, 6:48 PM):** A comprehensive suite of unit tests was added or significantly updated for the `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper`. These tests cover various scenarios for mapping attachment form fields, including cases with and without values, null extension configurations, and non-attachment field types, ensuring the UI model correctly represents field properties and supported file types.

*   **`/form_lib/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart` (Oct 28, 6:50 PM - 6:52 PM, multiple updates):** This file underwent rapid, iterative changes focused on refining the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController`. The core functionality includes parallel file uploads, tracking ongoing operations using `CancelableOperation`, and thread-safe model updates via `FSMutex`. The numerous small changes specifically target improvements and corrections in the `switch` statement logic for handling `UCResult` (success/error states) during attachment uploads, indicating an active adoption and debugging of Dart's pattern matching features.

*   **`/common_business/upload_file_to_itil_use_case.dart` (Oct 28, 6:53 PM - 7:00 PM):** The `UploadFileToItilUseCase` was transitioned from a placeholder implementation (throwing `UnimplementedError` after a delay) to a functional one. It now directly delegates the file upload task to the `_commonLibRepository.uploadItilAttachmentFile` method.

*   **`/journey_lib/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart` (Oct 29, 11:03 AM):** This mapper was implemented to translate various `JourneyFormField` objects, including custom fields that can encapsulate `JourneySection` (nested forms) and different attachment field types, into UI-specific models (`FormFieldUIModel`). It utilizes other mappers for common and attachment fields.

*   **`/journey_lib/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart` (Oct 29, 11:06 AM - 11:08 AM, multiple updates):** Unit tests for the `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper` were updated. These tests validate the mapping of various form field combinations, including empty lists, mixed field types (text, custom sections, attachments), and the correct differentiation between editable (upload-enabled) and non-editable (preview-only) attachment fields. There were minor iterations on how a "null" UI model scenario was tested.

*   **`/journey_lib/fs_journey_form_field.dart` (Oct 29, 11:35 AM - 12:09 PM, many rapid updates):** This file started as a basic placeholder widget and evolved significantly. It was refactored into `FSJourneyFormField`, a `StatelessWidget` designed to render individual form field UI models. The changes included:
    *   Implementing a `switch` expression to conditionally render different UI components (attachment preview, attachment upload, or generic common field) based on the `FormFieldUIModel` type.
    *   Correctly defining `onChanged` and `onAttachmentPreviewClicked` callbacks as widget properties.
    *   Resolving multiple issues related to `StatelessWidget` context, such as improper `widget.model` and `fieldKeys` references, which were gradually fixed to pass callbacks and data correctly.
    *   Renaming the attachment upload builder method for clarity (`_buildAttachmentField` to `_buildAttachmentWithUploadStateField`).

*   **`/journey_lib/fs_journey_form_section_field.dart` (Oct 29, 11:38 AM - 12:04 PM, several updates):** This `StatefulWidget` renders a section containing multiple child form fields. A major change was observed in its `_buildField` method:
    *   Initially, it contained inline logic for rendering attachment and common fields.
    *   It was refactored to delegate the rendering of individual child fields entirely to the newly developed `FSJourneyFormField`, promoting modularity.
    *   The `onChanged` callback logic was refined to correctly propagate updates from child `FormFieldUIModel` instances back to the parent `FormSectionFieldUIModel`.
    *   `GlobalKey` assignment to child `FSJourneyFormField` instances was added to support scrolling to specific fields within a section.
    *   Logging utility (`fs_logger`) was removed.

*   **`/journey_lib/journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart` (Oct 29, 11:46 AM - 11:51 AM, several updates):** This main form content widget manages the display and interaction of activity form fields. Its `build` method underwent a significant refactoring:
    *   It moved from directly handling attachment and common field rendering using its own internal methods (`_buildAttachmentPreviewField`, `_buildAttachmentField`, `_buildCommonField`).
    *   The rendering of these fields was delegated to the newly created `FSJourneyFormField` widget (via a new `_buildJourneyCommonField` method), centralizing field-specific UI logic and improving maintainability.

*   **`/search_lib/pubspec.yaml`, `search_api_model.dart`, `search_remote_data_source.dart` (Oct 29, 1:49 PM - 2:04 PM, multiple identical updates):** These entries represent the initial setup of a new `search_lib` library.
    *   The `pubspec.yaml` defines standard Flutter dependencies (e.g., `flutter_bloc`, `json_annotation`, `freezed`) and local package overrides, indicating a standard library setup within the monorepo.
    *   `search_api_model.dart` introduces `SearchApiModel` and `SearchResultsApiModel` using `freezed` and `json_annotation` for immutable data structures and JSON serialization, setting up the data contract for search results.
    *   `search_remote_data_source.dart` defines an abstract `SearchRemoteDataSource` and a stub `SearchRemoteDataSourceImpl` with a placeholder implementation, indicating the search API integration is pending.

*   **`.github/copilot-instructions.md` (Oct 29, 2:23 PM - 2:25 PM, multiple identical updates):** A comprehensive markdown document was added, detailing instructions for an AI assistant (likely GitHub Copilot). It outlines the project's overview, technologies, modular structure, good practices (Clean Architecture, BLoC, naming conventions, testing), and specific goals for AI assistance to ensure code quality and consistency.

**Overall Patterns:**

1.  **Modularity and Reusability:** A strong pattern of refactoring UI components to improve modularity and reuse is evident in the `journey_lib` updates, where inline rendering logic is moved into dedicated, smaller widgets (`FSJourneyFormField`) that are then used by parent widgets (`FSJourneyFormSectionField`, `JourneyFormDetailActivityFormContent`).

The log details active development across several modules, primarily focusing on enhancements to a "Journey" form system and the initial scaffolding of a "Search" library, all within a Flutter codebase adhering to a Clean Architecture pattern.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/domain/usecase/upload_file_to_itil_use_case.dart`** (10/28/2025, 7:00:43 PM):
    *   A new `UploadFileToItilUseCase` class was introduced. This use case leverages `CommonLibRepository` to handle the upload of local attachment files to ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library).

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart`** (10/29/2025, 11:03:36 AM):
    *   A comprehensive `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper` was implemented. This mapper translates `JourneyFormField` data models into UI-specific `FormFieldUIModel` representations.
    *   It includes logic to handle various field types via a `switch` statement, specifically `Custom` fields (such as `JourneySection`s) and `Attachment` fields, distinguishing between editable and non-editable attachments to map them to appropriate UI models (`FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel` vs `FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel`).
    *   It utilizes other mappers (`CommonFormFieldUIMapper`, `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper`, `JourneyAttachmentPreviewFormFieldUIMapper`) as dependencies.

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart`** (10/29/2025, 11:06:31 AM - 11:08:20 AM):
    *   This test file underwent several rapid modifications. Initially, it included a broad suite of tests for `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper`, covering scenarios like empty field lists, mapping various field types (including editable/non-editable attachments, custom sections, and mixed types), and filtering null UI models.
    *   There was a brief addition and subsequent removal of direct data model imports (`journey_form_field.dart`, `journey_section.dart`), and a refinement in how an "unknown custom field" test case was defined.
    *   Notably, several comprehensive test cases were removed by the last commit in this series, suggesting either a temporary pruning for focused development or a decision to simplify the test coverage in this file.

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form/section/field/fs_journey_form_field.dart`** (10/29/2025, 11:35:10 AM - 12:09:53 PM):
    *   This file saw intense, iterative development, evolving from a basic placeholder `MyWidget` into a specialized `FSJourneyFormField` widget.
    *   The `FSJourneyFormField` is a `StatelessWidget` designed to render individual form fields based on their `FormFieldUIModel` type.
    *   It uses a `switch` statement to conditionally render `FormAttachmentPreviewFieldUIModel`, `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateUIModel` (handled by `_buildAttachmentPreviewField` and `_buildAttachmentWithUploadStateField` methods, respectively), or a generic `FSFormCommonField`.
    *   Early commits struggled with `StatelessWidget` limitations, attempting to use `widget.model` and `fieldKeys` directly, which were later corrected by passing `onChanged` and `onAttachmentPreviewClicked` callbacks as parameters.
    *   The `_buildAttachmentField` method was consistently renamed to `_buildAttachmentWithUploadStateField` to match its usage.
    *   `fs_logger` was used for debugging the model being built.

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form/section/field/fs_journey_form_section_field.dart`** (10/29/2025, 11:38:01 AM - 12:04:06 PM):
    *   This new `FSJourneyFormSectionField` widget (a `StatefulWidget` extending `FSFormBaseField`) was introduced to render a collection of child form fields as a section.
    *   It includes support for scrolling to specific fields within the section using a `FSScrollToFormFieldNotifier` and `GlobalKey`s, which are managed within its `_SectionFieldContentState`.
    *   Initially, it had its own `switch` logic for rendering child fields, similar to `FSJourneyFormField`, but this was refactored to delegate the rendering of individual fields to the `FSJourneyFormField` widget, promoting reusability and separation of concerns.
    *   Logging with `fs_logger` was initially present but removed by 12:01:14 PM.
    *   A `key` was correctly added to the `FSJourneyFormField` instance within the section, linking child fields to their `GlobalKey`s for scrolling.

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/activity_form/journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart`** (10/29/2025, 11:46:20 AM - 11:51:28 AM):
    *   This file defines `JourneyFormDetailActivityFormContent`, a `StatefulWidget` responsible for displaying the main activity form, managing its form fields, and handling user interactions.
    *   It serves as a provider for `FSFormFieldUIModelProvider` and uses `FSScrollToFormFieldNotifier` to enable scrolling to specific form fields based on external events.
    *   The `build` method dynamically renders `visibleFields`, delegating section fields to `FSJourneyFormSectionField` and other common fields to `FSJourneyFormField`.
    *   It also contains a `getFormFieldUIModel` method to retrieve UI models from the `JourneyFormDetailBloc` state.

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/pubspec.yaml`** (10/29/2025, 1:49:16 PM - 3:27:35 PM):
    *   This `pubspec.yaml` for the `search_lib` module underwent significant changes.
    *   Initially, it listed basic Flutter and third-party dependencies (`json_annotation`, `get_it`, `http`, `freezed_annotation`, `flutter_bloc`, `infinite_scroll_pagination`) along with local `dependency_overrides`.
    *   In a major update (3:24:04 PM), it expanded to include a wide array of local library dependencies (`core`, `core_ui`, `common_base`, `common_business`, `common_ui`, `http_client`, `user_lib`, `common_test`, `form_lib`, `fs_logger`, `support_portal_lib`) and new third-party packages (`go_router`, `collection`, `url_launcher`, `provider`, `async`), and added an `assets/images/` section.
    *   Later, some dependencies (`url_launcher`, `provider`, `async`, `support_portal_lib`) were removed (3:27:18 PM, 3:27:35 PM), indicating refinement of the library's requirements.

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/model/search_api_model.dart`** (10/29/2025, 1:50:26 PM - 1:58:40 PM):
    *   This file defines `SearchApiModel` and `SearchResultsApiModel` using `freezed` and `json_annotation`. These immutable data models represent the structure of individual search results and the overall search API response, including pagination details. The file content remained consistent across multiple saves.

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/search_remote_data_source.dart`** (10/29/2025, 1:59:35 PM - 2:04:46 PM):
    *   An abstract `SearchRemoteDataSource` interface and its placeholder implementation `SearchRemoteDataSourceImpl` were defined. The implementation includes a `searchItems` method that currently returns an empty result set and uses a `SearchApiModelMapper`. This serves as a stub for future API integration.

*   **`/.github/copilot-instructions.md`** (10/29/2025, 2:23:56 PM - 2:25:56 PM):
    *   This document provides a detailed overview of the project's architecture, technologies, package structure, and good practices (Clean Architecture, BLoC, code generation with `freezed` and `json_serializable`, naming conventions, testing guidelines). Its repeated saves indicate its importance as a guiding document for development within the Freshservice Flutter codebase.

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/.gitignore`** (10/29/2025, 2:55:06 PM):
    *   A standard `.gitignore` file for a Flutter package was added, specifying files and directories to be ignored by version control (e.g., build artifacts, IDE-specific files).

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/.metadata`** (10/29/2025, 3:17:10 PM):
    *   The auto-generated Flutter `.metadata` file was added, tracking project properties like revision, channel, and project type.

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/search_lib.dart`** (10/29/2025, 3:31:25 PM - 3:31:37 PM):
    *   This library's main entry file briefly exported localization definitions, then was immediately replaced by a simple `Calculator` class, suggesting either a placeholder, a test, or an accidental commit before the final API was decided.

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/local/search_lib_local_data_source.dart`** (10/29/2025, 3:42:52 PM - 3:43:29 PM):
    *   An empty `SearchLibLocalDataSource` class was created as a stub for local data handling in the search module.

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/helper/search_lib_remote_constants.dart`** (10/29/2025, 3:44:38 PM):
    *   An empty `SearchLibRemoteConstants` class was created, likely for storing remote API-related constants.

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/src/data/repository/impl/search_lib_repository_impl.dart`** (10/29/2025, 3:45:55 PM):
    *   An empty `SearchLibRepositoryImpl` class was created as a stub for the search repository implementation.

*   **`/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/src/data/repository/search_lib_repository.dart`** (10/29/2025, 3:46:03 PM - 3:46:09 PM):
    *   An abstract interface `SearchLibRepository` was defined, marking the contract for the search feature's data layer.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **October 28, 2025, 7:00:43 PM:** Introduction of core business logic for file uploads (`UploadFileToItilUseCase`).
*   **October 29, 2025, ~11:00 AM - 12:00 PM:** Intensive development and refinement of UI components for journey forms (`JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper`, `FSJourneyFormField`, `FSJourneyFormSectionField`, `JourneyFormDetailActivityFormContent`), including handling complex field types and scroll functionality.
*   **October 29, 2025, ~1:49 PM - 3:46 PM:** Initial setup and progressive scaffolding of the new `search_lib` module, defining its `pubspec.yaml`, data models, and data source/repository interfaces.
*   **October 29, 2025, ~2:23 PM - 2:25 PM:** Repeated commits to the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file, indicating a focus on formalizing and reinforcing project development guidelines.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Clean Architecture Adherence:** File paths consistently follow `data/datasource`, `domain/usecase`, `ui/presentation/mapper`, `ui/view/components`, which aligns with the explicit guidelines in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. This indicates a strong architectural pattern is being followed across the codebase.
*   **Modular Development:** The creation of `journey_lib` and `search_lib` as distinct packages (Flutter libraries) demonstrates a modular monorepo structure, as described in the `copilot-instructions.md`.
*   **UI Component Refinement:** The `journey_lib` changes highlight a meticulous process of defining and refining UI widgets to handle diverse form field types, including complex nested structures (sections) and interactive elements (attachments with upload states). Iterative changes, commenting, and corrections indicate active, focused UI development.
*   **State Management and Data Flow:** The use of mappers (`JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper`) to translate domain models to UI models, and the `onChanged` callbacks for updating form states, are consistent with BLoC pattern principles outlined in the project instructions. `FSScrollToFormFieldNotifier` is used for cross-widget communication regarding scrolling.
*   **Code Generation:** The `search_lib` uses `freezed` and `json_annotation` for data models, requiring `build_runner`, which is also explicitly mentioned in the `copilot-instructions.md` as a good practice.
*   **Scaffolding:** Multiple empty or minimal classes (e.g., `SearchLibLocalDataSource`, `SearchLibRepositoryImpl`, `SearchLibRemoteConstants`) were created within `search_lib`, signaling the initial structural setup for a new feature or library.
*   **Dependency Management:** The `pubspec.yaml` updates demonstrate careful management of both internal package dependencies (e.g., `common_ui`, `form_lib`) and external third-party libraries, crucial for a large modular project.

**Summary of Significant Changes and Patterns:**

The log primarily captures the **initial scaffolding and integration of a new `search_lib` Flutter package**. This new library is being built following a **Clean Architecture pattern**, evident from the distinct `data`, `domain`, and `ui` directories, and the separation into `datasource`, `model`, `mapper`, `repository`, and `di` sub-layers.

**Key development phases observed on 10/29/2025:**

1.  **API Model and Remote Data Source Definition (1:51 PM - 2:04 PM):** The `SearchApiModel` and `SearchResultsApiModel` were defined using `freezed` and `json_annotation`, establishing the structure for API responses. A remote data source interface and a placeholder implementation were also created.
2.  **Project Guidelines and Configuration (2:23 PM - 3:17 PM):** Detailed AI assistant instructions (`copilot-instructions.md`) were added, outlining the project's architectural principles and coding standards. Standard `.gitignore` and `.metadata` files were also set up.
3.  **`search_lib` Core Development (3:24 PM - 4:16 PM):** This period saw rapid development within `search_lib`:
    *   Dependency adjustments in `pubspec.yaml`, removing unused packages.
    *   The `search_lib.dart` public API file was created and refined.
    *   Placeholder classes for local data source (`SearchLibLocalDataSource`) and remote constants were added.
    *   The remote data source (`SearchLibRemoteDataSource`) and repository (`SearchLibRepository` and `SearchLibRepositoryImpl`) were developed, defining their contracts and initial implementations with dependencies.
    *   Dependency Injection modules for the data, domain, and UI layers (`SearchLibDataModule`, `SearchLibDomainModule`, `SearchLibUiModule`, `SearchLibModule`) were created and populated, leveraging `fsDIComponent` (likely `get_it`). This signifies a strong adherence to DI principles.
4.  **`search_lib` Integration into `fsmodule` (4:20 PM - 4:32 PM):** The new `search_lib` was integrated into the main `fsmodule` application. This involved:
    *   Declaring `search_lib` as a dependency in `fsmodule/pubspec.yaml`.
    *   Adding `SearchLibModule.register()` to the `fsmodule`'s main DI module (`FSModuleDIModule`), ensuring its services are available application-wide.
    *   Including `SearchLibLocalizations.delegates` in `fs_module_app_widget.dart` for internationalization.
5.  **DI Test Setup (4:42 PM - 4:47 PM):** Dedicated unit tests were initiated to verify the `search_lib`'s dependency injection setup, demonstrating a commitment to testing from the outset.

**Recurring Elements/Patterns:**

*   **Consistent DI Pattern:** The `fsDIComponent.registerLazySingleton` pattern is heavily used across multiple `*_data_module.dart` files, indicating a standardized approach to dependency management throughout the monorepo.
*   **Clean Architecture Adherence:** The systematic creation of separate files and directories for `data`, `domain`, `ui`, `datasource`, `repository`, and `di` aligns directly with the Clean Architecture principles outlined in `copilot-instructions.md`.
*   **Code Generation:** Dependencies on `freezed`, `json_annotation`, `build_runner`, and `json_serializable` in `pubspec.yaml` files, along with `part` directives, highlight the extensive use of code generation for immutable models and serialization.
*   **Iterative Development & Refinement:** Multiple identical log entries for a single file suggest frequent saving or regeneration without functional changes, but also show a clear progression of development as placeholder implementations evolve into more complete structures, often with intermediate fixes for typos or incomplete code.
*   **Placeholder/TODO Comments:** The use of `TODO` comments for unimplemented logic (e.g., actual API calls) is a recurring pattern for initial scaffolding.

    *   **Timestamp:** 4:45:27 PM (initial empty test file) to 4:47:56 PM (final test logic).
    *   **Updates:** This file for unit testing `search_lib`'s DI setup was developed:
        *   Started with a basic `setUp` function.
        *   Imports for `flutter_test`, `search_lib`, and `search_lib_di_module` were added.
        *   **4:46:44 PM:** `setUp` was correctly configured to register both the test DI and the `SearchLibModule`.
        *   **4:47:56 PM:** A `group("DI Test")` was added with a specific `test("DI Test - SearchLibDataModule")` case, including `fsDIComponent.get` calls and `expect` statements to verify that `SearchLibRemoteDataSource`, `SearchLibLocalDataSource`, and `SearchLibRepository` were correctly registered and resolvable. Several typos and incomplete lines were swiftly corrected during this process.

22. **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/l10n/base/intl_en.arb`**:
    *   **Timestamp:** 5:05:13 PM (initial incomplete entry) to 5:08:01 PM (final state).
    *   **Updates:** This English localization file for `search_lib` was created and refined:
        *   `"recentSearches": "Recent searches"` (5:05:29 PM) and `"clearAll": "Clear all"` (5:05:41 PM) were added.
        *   A `"noMatches"` message was iteratively added and improved, eventually including a dynamic `{query}` placeholder and its associated `@noMatches` metadata for internationalization between 5:06:44 PM and 5:08:01 PM.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **New Module Scaffolding:** The log provides a clear pattern for creating a new Flutter library (`search_lib`), including `.gitignore`, `.metadata`, `pubspec.yaml`, and a layered `lib/src/{data, domain, ui}/di` structure, all following the Clean Architecture guidelines.
*   **Clean Architecture Implementation:** The consistent creation of `DataSource` (local/remote), `Repository` (interface and implementation), and `DI Module` for `data`, `domain`, and `ui` layers highlights strict adherence to Clean Architecture.
*   **Dependency Injection (DI) driven development:** The frequent use of `fsDIComponent.registerLazySingleton` and explicit DI modules across layers is a central theme, demonstrating a strong emphasis on testability and modularity.
*   **Iterative Refinement and Correction:** Numerous small, rapid changes (often within seconds or minutes of each other) to fix typos, complete code snippets, correct imports, or refine existing implementations are observed. This indicates an active development cycle, possibly leveraging real-time coding assistance.
*   **Integration Process:** The `search_lib` module's integration into the main `fsmodule` application is shown through updates to the `fsmodule`'s `pubspec.yaml`, main DI module (`fs_module_di_module.dart`), and localization delegates (`fs_module_app_widget.dart`).
*   **Testing as part of Development:** The immediate setup of DI tests (`search_lib_module_test.dart`) alongside the module's implementation demonstrates a test-driven or test-inclusive development approach.
*   **Localization Adoption:** The creation and refinement of `intl_en.arb` for `search_lib` indicates the standard process for adding internationalization support to new modules.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/29/2025, 3:24 PM**: Initial `pubspec.yaml` for `search_lib` is defined.
*   **10/29/2025, 3:27 PM**: `search_lib` dependencies are refined (removed and re-added `support_portal_lib`, removed `go_router_builder`, `url_launcher`, `provider`, `async`).
*   **10/29/2025, 4:08 PM**: The `search_lib` data layer DI module (`search_lib_data_module.dart`) is fully configured, registering data sources and the repository.
*   **10/29/2025, 4:16 PM**: The main `SearchLibModule` is finalized to register all its sub-layer DI modules (data, domain, UI).
*   **10/29/2025, 4:20 PM**: `search_lib` module is integrated into the main application's DI (`fs_module_di_module.dart`).
*   **10/29/2025, 4:21 PM**: `search_lib` is added as a dependency in the main application's `pubspec.yaml`.
*   **10/29/2025, 4:32 PM**: `search_lib`'s localization delegates are integrated into the main `FSModuleAppWidget`.
*   **10/29/2025, 4:47 PM**: Unit tests for `search_lib`'s data layer DI are implemented.
*   **10/29/2025, 5:08 PM**: `search_lib`'s localization file (`intl_en.arb`) is completed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Development and Clean Architecture:** The primary pattern is the creation of a new, self-contained Flutter package (`search_lib`) that strictly adheres to Clean Architecture principles. This is evident in the separate directories for `data`, `domain`, and `ui` layers, each with their own data sources (local/remote), repositories, and dependency injection modules.
*   **Dependency Injection (DI):** `get_it` (via `fsDIComponent`) is extensively used across the codebase for managing dependencies. There's a clear pattern of creating DI modules for each architectural layer (`SearchLibDataModule`, `SearchLibDomainModule`, `SearchLibUiModule`) and a central module (`SearchLibModule`) to register them.
*   **Localization (`l10n`):** The process includes creating a base `.arb` file for internationalization strings and exporting a generated localization delegate, which is then integrated into the main application.
*   **Testing:** A consistent approach to testing is followed, where a dedicated DI test module (`SearchLibDIModuleTest`) and specific unit tests are created to verify the correct registration of dependencies for the new module. This often involves adapting from existing test patterns.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Many changes involve minor corrections (e.g., typos in `pubspec.yaml` and `.dart` files, refining DI registrations), indicating an iterative development process.
*   **Monorepo Integration:** The process demonstrates how a new module is integrated into a larger monorepo, requiring updates to its own `pubspec.yaml`, the main application's `pubspec.yaml`, and the main application's central DI and UI configurations.

## 8:24:00 PM
The changes primarily document the initial setup and integration of a new `search_lib` Flutter library into the existing Freshservice mobile application, alongside minor adjustments to an existing `journey_lib` module.

    *   Initially an empty class, it evolved to depend on both `SearchLibRemoteDataSource` and `SearchLibLocalDataSource`.
    *   It was finalized by implementing the `SearchLibRepository` interface, establishing its role as the data layer's entry point.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/src/data/di/search_lib_data_module.dart` (10/29/2025, 4:06:45 PM - 4:08:48 PM):**
    *   This file systematically registered the `SearchLibRemoteDataSource`, `SearchLibLocalDataSource`, and `SearchLibRepository` within the dependency injection system (`fsDIComponent`). Several quick iterations corrected initial copy-paste errors and incomplete code.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/src/domain/di/search_lib_domain_module.dart` (10/29/2025, 4:11:44 PM - 4:12:05 PM):** A `SearchLibDomainModule` was created as a placeholder for future domain layer dependency registrations, specifically for `UseCases`.

    *   The application's main widget was updated to import `search_lib.dart` and include `SearchLibLocalizations.delegates` in its `localizationsDelegates` list, enabling localization for the new library.
    *   A significant change at 5:32:43 PM altered how `localizationsDelegates` are structured, removing the spread operator `...` from most custom delegates and duplicating the global delegates.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/test/di/search_lib_di_module.dart` (10/29/2025, 4:42:51 PM - 4:46:26 PM):** A test-specific DI module (`SearchLibDIModuleTest`) was set up, initially containing copy-pasted `support_portal_lib` registrations, which were then corrected to only register common test dependencies.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/test/di/search_lib_module_test.dart` (10/29/2025, 4:45:27 PM - 4:47:56 PM):** Unit tests were developed to verify the successful registration of `search_lib`'s data layer components (`SearchLibRemoteDataSource`, `SearchLibLocalDataSource`, `SearchLibRepository`) within the `fsDIComponent`. Initial incomplete lines and typos were corrected throughout the process.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/l10n/base/intl_en.arb` (10/29/2025, 5:05:13 PM - 5:08:01 PM):** This localization file for `search_lib` was populated with English strings for "Recent searches", "Clear all", and a dynamic "No matches for {query}" message, including the necessary ARB metadata for the placeholder.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper.dart` (10/29/2025, 7:11:02 PM):** This specific mapper for attachment fields was updated. The logic for determining `attachmentExtensionConfig` now explicitly sets it to `null` if `supportedTypes` is `null`, rather than defaulting to an empty list of whitelisted extensions.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart` (10/29/2025, 7:01:06 PM - 7:15:10 PM):** Unit tests for `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper` were present. A key change was removing an unused fixture import (7:01:17 PM). Although the mapper logic changed at 7:11:02 PM regarding `attachmentExtensionConfig` for null `supportedTypes`, the test case expectations for this scenario in this log **did not reflect that change**, continuing to expect an empty `AttachmentExtensionConfigWithUTIInfo` rather than `null`. This implies the tests were saved without updating to match the new mapper logic.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart` (10/29/2025, 6:58:30 PM) and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/testfixture/ui/form_detail/journey_activity_form_field_ui_model_fixture.dart` (10/29/2025, 7:40:57 PM - 7:42:30 PM):** These files, detailing a form field mapper and a comprehensive UI model fixture for journey activities, were logged multiple times without significant content changes, indicating frequent saves during development or testing of related components.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **Late Afternoon (Approx. 2:30 PM - 4:30 PM):** Focused work on creating the `search_lib` package, defining its `pubspec.yaml`, setting up its data layer (local/remote data sources, repository), and configuring its dependency injection modules across data, domain, and UI layers. This period also included integrating `search_lib` into the main `fsmodule` application's DI and `pubspec.yaml`.
*   **Late Afternoon (Approx. 4:30 PM - 5:10 PM):** Development shifted to setting up localization for `search_lib` (`intl_en.arb`) and creating initial DI unit tests for `search_lib`.
*   **Early Evening (Approx. 5:30 PM):** Critical modifications to `fs_module_app_widget.dart` were made, initially attempting to change how `localizationsDelegates` are structured, then reverting, and finally making a problematic change by removing spread operators from custom delegates and duplicating global ones.
*   **Evening (Approx. 6:58 PM - 7:15 PM):** Modifications and testing occurred within the `journey_lib` module, specifically a change in how `attachmentExtensionConfig` is handled in `journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper.dart`, though its corresponding unit tests were not fully updated to reflect this logic change.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **New Library Scaffolding:** The process for `search_lib` demonstrates a clear pattern for creating new Flutter modules in the Freshservice codebase: define `pubspec.yaml`, create data/domain/UI layers with DI modules, and then integrate into the main app's DI and localization.
*   **Clean Architecture Adherence:** The creation of separate data, domain, and UI DI modules (`search_lib_data_module.dart`, `search_lib_domain_module.dart`, `search_lib_ui_module.dart`) aligns with the Clean Architecture principles outlined in `copilot-instructions.md`.
*   **Dependency Injection (DI):** Consistent use of `fsDIComponent.registerLazySingleton` for managing dependencies across layers is a strong pattern.
*   **Localization (`l10n`):** New packages include an `l10n` directory with `.arb` files and generate `_localizations.dart` for internationalization.
*   **Iterative Development & Corrections:** There are numerous small, rapid changes and corrections (e.g., fixing typos, completing incomplete code lines, adjusting DI registrations, removing incorrect imports), indicating an iterative development approach.
*   **Copy-Paste & Refinement:** Early stages of new file creation often show remnants of copy-pasted code (e.g., `support_portal_lib` references in `search_lib` test DI), which are subsequently cleaned up.
*   **Testing Focus:** Immediate creation of unit test files (`search_lib_module_test.dart`) for DI registration highlights a commitment to testing, as emphasized in `copilot-instructions.md`.
*   **Timezone Initialization:** `FsTestApp.initializeTimeZones()` is consistently called in `setUp` blocks of test files, suggesting a common testing utility for handling timezones.

## 9:24:22 PM
The log details a significant set of changes, primarily focused on the creation and integration of a new Flutter package, `search_lib`, into an existing Freshservice mobile application. The modifications span core package definition, data and UI layer development, dependency injection setup, localization, and integration into the main application module.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/.metadata` (10/29/2025, 3:17:10 PM):** This file was updated to define the `search_lib` as a Flutter package project, specifying its revision, channel, and project type. This marks the initial setup of the `search_lib` package.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/pubspec.yaml` (10/29/2025, 3:24:04 PM - 3:27:35 PM):**
    *   Initially, this file was configured for the `search_lib` package, setting its description, version, Flutter SDK (`3.7.2`), and Flutter version (`3.29.2`). It declared a wide array of local and third-party dependencies, including `core`, `user_lib`, `flutter_bloc`, and `go_router`.
    *   Subsequent rapid changes involved removing specific `dev_dependencies` like `go_router_builder` (at 3:27:00 PM), and several `dependencies` such as `url_launcher`, `provider`, `async`, and `support_portal_lib` (between 3:27:18 PM and 3:27:35 PM). This indicates a swift refinement of its required dependencies shortly after creation.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/search_lib.dart` (10/29/2025, 3:31:25 PM - 4:31:19 PM):**
    *   This file initially contained a placeholder export for `support_portal_lib_localizations.dart` (likely a copy-paste error), followed by a generic `Calculator` class (at 3:31:37 PM).
    *   Later, its content was cleared (4:30:00 PM) and then correctly updated to export its own localization (`search_lib_localizations.dart`) and Dependency Injection (DI) module (`search_lib_module.dart`) at around 4:30:59 PM and 4:31:19 PM.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/local/search_lib_local_data_source.dart` (10/29/2025, 3:42:52 PM - 3:43:29 PM):** This file was created to define an empty `SearchLibLocalDataSource` class, with minor whitespace adjustments in subsequent commits.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/src/data/repository/search_lib_repository.dart` (10/29/2025, 3:46:03 PM - 3:46:09 PM):** An abstract interface `SearchLibRepository` was defined, with a quick correction of a typo in its declaration.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/src/data/datasource/remote/search_lib_remote_data_source.dart` (10/29/2025, 3:54:00 PM - 4:03:56 PM):**
    *   An empty `SearchLibRemoteDataSource` class was created.
    *   It was then enhanced by adding a `_commonDataExceptionMapper` field and a `const` constructor for dependency injection, requiring an import from `user_lib` (around 3:54:55 PM to 4:03:56 PM).

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/src/data/repository/impl/search_lib_repository_impl.dart` (10/29/2025, 3:45:55 PM - 4:10:50 PM):**
    *   Started as an empty `SearchLibRepositoryImpl` class.
    *   It progressively grew to include `SearchLibRemoteDataSource` and `SearchLibLocalDataSource` as final fields, along with their respective constructor-based dependency injection. It also imported these data sources and was updated to `implement SearchLibRepository` at 4:10:50 PM.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/src/data/di/search_lib_data_module.dart` (10/29/2025, 4:06:45 PM - 4:08:48 PM):**
    *   This DI module was created and iteratively developed.
    *   It defined a `static void register()` method responsible for registering `SearchLibRemoteDataSource` and `SearchLibLocalDataSource` as lazy singletons using `fsDIComponent`.
    *   Crucially, `SearchLibRepository` was also registered using `SearchLibRepositoryImpl` (around 4:08:30 PM - 4:08:48 PM).

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/src/domain/di/search_lib_domain_module.dart` (10/29/2025, 4:11:44 PM - 4:12:05 PM):** A placeholder DI module for the domain layer, initially empty, indicating future use case registrations.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/src/ui/di/search_lib_ui_module.dart` (10/29/2025, 4:13:33 PM - 4:14:04 PM):** A placeholder DI module for the UI layer, initially empty, awaiting bloc/provider registrations.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/src/di/search_lib_module.dart` (10/29/2025, 4:15:49 PM - 4:16:48 PM):** This top-level DI module for `search_lib` was introduced. Its `register` method orchestrates the registration of its data, domain, and UI DI modules.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/lib/src/di/fs_module_di_module.dart` (10/29/2025, 4:20:36 PM - 4:27:10 PM):** This central DI module for the main `fsmodule` application was updated multiple times to integrate `SearchLibModule.register()` into its `registeLibraryPackages()` method. Imports for `search_lib` were also added and refined.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/pubspec.yaml` (10/29/2025, 4:21:08 PM - 4:28:21 PM):** The main application's `pubspec.yaml` was updated to include `search_lib: '1.0.0'` as a local dependency. Its position in the `Local Packages` list was also adjusted (alphabetically sorted).

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/lib/src/ui/fs_module_app_widget.dart` (10/29/2025, 4:32:34 PM - 5:32:43 PM):** This widget, responsible for the application's root UI and localization delegates, was modified to include `SearchLibLocalizations.delegates` in its `localizationsDelegates` list. There were also subsequent minor formatting changes and a potentially incomplete or erroneous refactor of how delegates were listed (5:32:43 PM).

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/test/di/search_lib_di_module.dart` (10/29/2025, 4:42:51 PM - 4:46:26 PM):**
    *   A test-specific DI module, `SearchLibDIModuleTest`, was created.
    *   It underwent several revisions to correctly register common test dependencies and remove misplaced `SupportPortalLibModule` registrations, making it suitable for testing `search_lib`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/test/di/search_lib_module_test.dart` (10/29/2025, 4:45:27 PM - 4:47:56 PM):**
    *   This file defines the unit tests for `search_lib`'s DI setup.
    *   It includes a `setUp` block to register both the test DI module and the main `SearchLibModule`.
    *   A test group "DI Test" was added, containing a test case to verify that `SearchLibRemoteDataSource`, `SearchLibLocalDataSource`, and `SearchLibRepository` are correctly registered in the DI component.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/search_lib/lib/l10n/base/intl_en.arb` (10/29/2025, 5:05:13 PM - 5:08:01 PM):** This localization file was progressively built out. It started with partial entries and was refined to include `recentSearches`, `clearAll`, and a dynamic `noMatches` message with a `{query}` placeholder and its associated metadata for localization.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_activity_form_field_ui_mapper.dart` (10/29/2025, 6:58:30 PM - 7:11:02 PM):** This file saw a significant refactoring. It initially defined a comprehensive `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper`. This was later replaced by a more focused `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper` (at 7:11:02 PM), suggesting a redesign or splitting of responsibilities for form field mapping. The new mapper specifically handles attachment fields and their configurations.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/ui/form_detail/presentation/mapper/journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart` (10/29/2025, 7:01:06 PM - 7:15:10 PM):** These unit tests for the attachment form field mapper were updated to align with the changes in the `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper`. Specifically, test expectations for `attachmentExtensionConfig` when `supportedTypes` are null were adjusted from a default empty configuration to `null`, reflecting the updated mapper logic (around 7:12:44 PM).

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/testfixture/ui/form_detail/journey_activity_form_field_ui_model_fixture.dart` (10/29/2025, 7:40:57 PM - 9:00:37 PM):** This test fixture, used for generating complex `JourneyActivityFormUIModel` objects, remained functionally stable across multiple timestamps, indicating its role as a consistent data provider for tests.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes (all occurring on 10/29/2025):**

*   **Early Afternoon (3:17 PM - 3:27 PM):** Initial package setup and rapid dependency pruning for `search_lib`.
*   **Mid-Afternoon (3:31 PM - 4:16 PM):** Concentrated development of `search_lib`'s data layer (datasources, repository, DI) and initial domain/UI DI module structures.
*   **Late Afternoon (4:20 PM - 4:32 PM):** Integration of the new `search_lib` module into the main `fsmodule` application's dependencies and DI system.
*   **Late Afternoon (4:42 PM - 4:47 PM):** Development and refinement of DI unit tests specifically for `search_lib`.
*   **Early Evening (5:05 PM - 5:08 PM):** Creation and detailed refinement of localization strings for the `search_lib`.
*   **Evening (6:58 PM - 7:15 PM):** A significant refactoring in `journey_lib`'s form field mappers, leading to a more specialized `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper` and corresponding test updates.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Layered Architecture:** The `search_lib` package is developed following a clear layered architecture (data, domain, UI), with dedicated directories for datasources (local, remote), repositories, and DI modules for each layer.
2.  **Dependency Injection (DI):** The `fsDIComponent` is a central and recurring element, extensively used to register services (datasources, repositories) as lazy singletons across multiple modules (`search_lib_data_module.dart`, `search_lib_module.dart`, `fs_module_di_module.dart`). This indicates a consistent DI pattern throughout the project.
3.  **Incremental Development:** New classes and files often start as empty shells or with minimal boilerplate and are gradually expanded with imports, fields, constructors, and implementations (e.g., `SearchLibRemoteDataSource`, `SearchLibRepositoryImpl`, `intl_en.arb`).
4.  **Test-Driven/Aligned Development:** The creation and refinement of `_di_module.dart` and `_module_test.dart` files for both `search_lib` and `support_portal_lib` (used as a reference) demonstrate a strong emphasis on testing DI configurations. Test expectations are also adjusted swiftly when underlying code logic changes, as seen with the `journey_attachment_form_field_ui_mapper_test.dart`.
5.  **Localization Integration:** New UI-facing modules are expected to include `.arb` localization files and integrate their delegates into the main application's `localizationsDelegates` list.
6.  **Package Management in `pubspec.yaml`:** Dependency declarations in `pubspec.yaml` files are critical and frequently updated for new packages and managing versions. The organization of local packages (alphabetical sorting) is also observed.
7.  **Refactoring and Specialization:** The change from a generic `JourneyActivityFormFieldUIMapper` to a specialized `JourneyAttachmentFormFieldUIMapper` within `journey_lib` highlights an ongoing process of refining code structure and responsibilities.
