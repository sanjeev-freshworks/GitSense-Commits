# Activity Summary for 10/26/2025

## 12:40:56 AM
The provided log details changes exclusively to the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`. This file appears to manage attachment uploads within a Freshservice Flutter application, specifically for ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) related forms.

**Key Changes and Timestamps:**

*   **10/25/2025, 11:55:34 PM - 10/26/2025, 12:06:04 AM (Initial Cancellation Mechanism Refinement):** This period shows a focused effort on refining the attachment upload cancellation logic.
    *   Initially, the `_ongoingUploads` map stored `CancelableOperation` objects from the `async` package.
    *   Between 11:55:34 PM and 11:59:43 PM, the exception handling for cancellation within `_uploadFilesParallely` evolved from `CanceledException` to `CancellationException`, then `CancelableOperationCanceledError`, and finally `Cancel`. This suggests a struggle to identify the correct cancellation exception type from the `async` package.
    *   At 10/26/2025, 12:02:56 AM, the `try-on-catch` block was refactored. Instead of specific cancellation exceptions, a generic `catch (error)` block was introduced. Inside this block, `cancelableOperation.isCanceled` was checked to differentiate between a cancellation and a general upload failure. This robust change handles cancellation more reliably within the generic error handler.
    *   The `removeAttachment` and `dispose` methods consistently used `_cancelUpload` and `_cancelAllUploads` respectively, which relied on the `CancelableOperation.cancel()` method.

*   **10/26/2025, 12:22:48 AM - 10/26/2025, 12:36:08 AM (Shift to `Completer` for Cancellation):** A significant architectural change occurred here, moving away from `CancelableOperation` to Dart's native `Completer` for managing and signaling cancellations.
    *   At 10/26/2025, 12:22:48 AM, the `import 'package:async/async.dart';` was removed, and `import 'dart:async';` was added. Correspondingly, `_ongoingUploads` (Map<AttachmentLocalFile, CancelableOperation>) was replaced with `_uploadCompleters` (Map<AttachmentLocalFile, Completer<void>>).
    *   The `_uploadFilesParallely` method was updated to create a `Completer` for each attachment and store it. The `await _uploadFileToItilUseCase!.call(attachment)` call was no longer wrapped in a `CancelableOperation`. Instead, a check `if (completer.isCompleted)` was introduced *after* the `await` call to see if a cancellation was requested mid-upload.
    *   The `removeAttachment` and `dispose` methods were updated to interact with `_uploadCompleters`. Instead of calling `cancel()` on a `CancelableOperation`, they now call `completer.complete()` or `completer.completeError()` on the `Completer` to signal cancellation. There were a few iterative changes in how `dispose` handled `complete()` vs `completeError()`, eventually settling on `completer.complete()` at 12:36:08 AM.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Logging:** `FSLogger.logWithTag(_tag, ...)` is used extensively throughout the controller to log attachment upload progress, states, and errors.
*   **Immutability and `copyWith`:** The controller consistently updates its model (`FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`) by creating new instances using `getCurrentModel().copyWith(...)` and then calling `onModelChanged()`. This pattern suggests a Redux-like or BLoC-like state management approach where state objects are immutable.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The `UploadFileToItilUseCase` is injected into the controller, with a fallback to `fsDIComponent.get<UploadFileToItilUseCase>()`, indicating a dependency injection framework is in use.
*   **Parallel Processing:** The `_uploadFilesParallely` method, which utilizes `Future.wait(uploadFutures)`, clearly indicates an intention for attachments to be uploaded concurrently.
*   **Attachment State Management:** The controller manages the state of each attachment upload (`AttachmentUploadStateInProgress`, `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess`, `AttachmentUploadStateError`) and updates a map (`uploadResultMap`) within the UI model.
*   **Retry Mechanism:** A `retryUpload` function is present, which re-initiates an upload for a specific file, clearing any previous ongoing upload for that file.
*   **Clean-up on Dispose:** The `dispose` method consistently includes logic to cancel all ongoing uploads and nullify the `_uploadFileToItilUseCase` to prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

## 4:13:51 AM
The provided log details a series of closely timed code changes on October 26, 2025, focusing primarily on enhancing attachment handling within a Flutter Freshservice application's form library.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart` (Timestamp: 10/26/2025, 12:47:30 AM)**
    *   A new controller, `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController`, was introduced.
    *   This controller manages the upload of attachments to ITIL, including parallel uploads, tracking upload states (InProgress, Success, Error), and handling file cancellation and removal.
    *   It uses a `Map<AttachmentLocalFile, Completer<void>>` to manage ongoing upload tasks, enabling robust cancellation logic.
    *   It interacts with `UploadFileToItilUseCase` for the actual upload business logic and uses `onModelChanged` to update the UI model with attachment states.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/fields/form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model.dart` (Multiple timestamps between 10/26/2025, 12:53:35 AM and 12:54:31 AM)**
    *   This UI model, `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`, was significantly refined.
    *   Initially, it defined properties like `uploadResultMap` and `attachments` to hold upload states and local files.
    *   Later updates involved implementing or clarifying inherited abstract methods from `FormFieldUIModel`:
        *   `getFieldValueForConditionValidation()` was initially unimplemented, then changed to return `null` with a comment indicating that conditions cannot be added to attachment fields (10/26/2025, 12:54:12 AM).
        *   The `hasValue` getter was implemented to check if the `attachments` list is not empty (10/26/2025, 12:54:31 AM).
    *   Minor constructor adjustments were made for `attachments` and `isShowAttachmentPicker` initialization.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/validator/common_form_field_validator.dart` (Multiple timestamps between 10/26/2025, 12:55:21 AM and 12:58:30 AM)**
    *   The central `CommonFormFieldValidator` underwent several changes to accommodate the new `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`.
    *   Initially, the validator explicitly threw an `UnimplementedError` for this new model type (10/26/2025, 12:55:21 AM).
    *   It then transitioned through using a general attachment validator (`_attachmentFieldValidator`), to attempting an incorrect nested validator call (passing `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateFieldValidator` as an argument to `_attachmentFieldValidator.validate`), and finally correctly integrating a dedicated validator.
    *   A new private field, `_attachmentWithUploadStateFieldValidator` of type `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateFieldValidator`, was added to the `CommonFormFieldValidator` class (10/26/2025, 12:56:40 AM).
    *   The `switch` statement within the `validate` method was updated to correctly use this new dedicated validator for `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` (10/26/2025, 12:57:42 AM).
    *   Comments indicating `TODO: Handle this case` were removed, and descriptive comments were added.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/di/form_lib_ui_fields_module.dart` (Timestamp: 10/26/2025, 12:57:26 AM)**
    *   The Dependency Injection (DI) module was updated.
    *   `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateFieldValidator` was registered as a factory with `fsDIComponent`.
    *   The factory registration for `CommonFormFieldValidator` was modified to inject an instance of the newly registered `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateFieldValidator` into its constructor.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/attachment/attachment_item_card.dart` (Timestamp: 10/26/2025, 12:59:14 AM)**
    *   The `AttachmentItemCard` UI component was enhanced.
    *   A new `isUploadFailed` boolean property was added to visually indicate a failed upload state.
    *   The card's border color now dynamically changes to an error-mild color if `isUploadFailed` is true, providing visual feedback to the user.
    *   Tapping functionality via `InkWell` is conditionally applied, excluding cases where the upload has failed.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/form_field_ui_model.dart` (Timestamp: 10/26/2025, 1:10:24 AM)**
    *   The base `FormFieldUIModel` file was updated to include new `part` declarations for `form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model.dart` and `form_attachment_preview_field_ui_model.dart`, signifying their integration into the core form field structure.
    *   Abstract getters `hasValue` and `getFieldValueForConditionValidation()` were formally defined in the `FormFieldUIModel` sealed class, ensuring all implementing classes provide these.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Attachment Feature Development:** A clear pattern is the dedicated development of a robust attachment handling feature, spanning from UI models to controllers and validators.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Changes in the `form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model.dart` and `common_form_field_validator.dart` files show an iterative process of initially adding placeholders or basic implementations, followed by detailed refinements and corrections.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The use of `part` files for UI models and separate validator classes (`FormAttachmentWithUploadStateFieldValidator`) highlights a modular approach.
*   **Dependency Injection (DI):** `fsDIComponent` is consistently used to register and retrieve dependencies, ensuring maintainable and testable code.
*   **UI Feedback:** The `AttachmentItemCard` update demonstrates attention to user experience by providing visual cues for attachment upload status.
*   **Rapid Development:** All modifications occurred within a concise timeframe on the same day, indicating a focused effort on this particular feature set.

## 10:18:40 AM
On 10/26/2025 at 10:16:10 AM, a significant update was made to the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`. This file introduces the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` class, a Dart controller designed to manage the upload lifecycle of ITIL attachments within a Flutter application.

Key updates and functionalities include:

*   **ITIL Attachment Upload Management:** The controller handles the end-to-end process of uploading attachments specifically for ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) contexts, utilizing an injected `UploadFileToItilUseCase`.
*   **Concurrent and Cancellable Uploads:** It features `_uploadFilesParallely` which allows multiple attachments to be uploaded concurrently. A crucial enhancement is the implementation of `CancelableOperation` from the `async` package, enabling the cancellation of individual or all ongoing uploads, significantly improving user experience.
*   **Robust State Management:** The controller interacts with a `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` to update the UI state. It provides `onModelChanged` and `getCurrentModel` callbacks to reflect various upload states: `InProgress`, `Success`, `Error`, and handles `CanceledException`.
*   **Comprehensive Lifecycle Operations:** Methods are available for initiating new uploads (`uploadFile`), retrying failed ones (`retryUpload`), removing attachments (`removeAttachment`), and disposing of the controller (`dispose`) which includes canceling all pending uploads.
*   **Error and Cancellation Handling:** The code explicitly differentiates between upload errors and cancellations, ensuring the UI model is updated correctly in each scenario. When an upload is cancelled, the attachment is removed from the pending list.
*   **Logging:** Extensive use of `FSLogger` with a consistent `_tag` (`FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController`) is present throughout the class for detailed logging of operations, progress, and errors.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The `UploadFileToItilUseCase` is obtained via `fsDIComponent.get`, indicating a dependency injection pattern for business logic.

Overall, this change introduces a robust and user-friendly mechanism for handling ITIL attachment uploads, focusing on concurrency, cancellability, and clear state management.

## 11:18:56 AM
The provided logs detail changes across two Dart files primarily related to attachment upload functionality within a Freshservice mobile application. The overall theme revolves around enhancing attachment upload robustness, cancellation, and error handling.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`**

This file, `fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`, underwent significant iterative development focusing on the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` class.
*   **Initial state (10/26/2025, 10:20:55 AM)**: The controller was established to manage parallel attachment uploads using `CancelableOperation` from the `async` package, with capabilities for initiating uploads, retrying, removing attachments, and cancelling individual or all ongoing uploads. It interacts with a `UploadFileToItilUseCase` and updates a UI model via callbacks.
*   **Early refinements (10:21 AM - 10:23 AM)**: Minor code formatting and comment additions were observed, along with a brief period (10:22:43 AM - 10:22:52 AM) where a syntax error (`..valu`) was introduced and subsequently fixed (10:23:18 AM).
*   **CanceledException definition (10:29 AM - 10:31 AM)**: A custom `CanceledException` class was defined. This process involved several small corrections:
    *   Initial incomplete attempts (10:29:43 AM, 10:29:50 AM).
    *   Proper definition with a message and `toString()` override (10:29:59 AM).
    *   Brief simplification (10:30:16 AM).
    *   An accidental misnaming as `InvalidPageException` in its internal implementation (10:31:27 AM), which was quickly corrected (10:31:38 AM).
    *   Addition of `const` to the `CanceledException` constructor (10:31:48 AM).
*   **Enhanced cancellation logic (10/26/2025, 10:32:14 AM)**: A crucial update added an `onCancel` callback to `CancelableOperation.fromFuture`. This callback explicitly logs the cancellation and throws the custom `CanceledException`, ensuring proper propagation of cancellation events within the upload process.
*   **Retry for failed uploads (10/26/2025, 10:50:17 AM)**: New methods were introduced to provide more comprehensive retry functionality: `retryAllFailedUploads()`, `getFailedAttachments()`, and `hasFailedAttachments()`. This allows users to re-attempt all uploads that previously encountered an error.
*   **Minor code reordering (10:51:44 AM - 10:51:59 AM)**: A temporary reordering of the `_ongoingUploads.remove(attachment)` call for successful uploads was introduced and then reverted shortly after, indicating a review of the exact timing of state updates.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/domain/usecase/upload_file_to_itil_use_case.dart`**

This file, `upload_file_to_itil_use_case.dart`, defines the `UploadFileToItilUseCase` responsible for the actual file upload logic.
*   **Initial placeholder (10/26/2025, 10:58:19 AM)**: The `protectedExecute` method, which contains the core logic, was initially empty.
*   **Simulated failure (10:58:39 AM - 10:58:50 AM)**: The `protectedExecute` method was updated to simulate an upload failure by introducing a 3-second delay followed by throwing a generic `Exception('Hello exception')`. The `async` keyword was correctly added to the method signature in a subsequent commit (10:58:50 AM). This change was likely for testing the error handling and retry mechanisms implemented in the controller.
*   **Logging integration (10:59:53 AM - 11:01:04 AM)**: Logging was progressively added to this use case:
    *   Initial attempt to log (10:59:53 AM) without a proper `fs_logger` import.
    *   A temporary incorrect import (11:00:01 AM) aliasing `dart:math` as `FSLogger`, which was then used in the log call (11:00:13 AM).
    *   The incorrect import was removed (11:00:37 AM) and then the correct `package:fs_logger/fs_logger.dart` was imported (11:00:45 AM).
    *   The logging message was slightly adjusted to log the entire `AttachmentLocalFile` object (11:01:04 AM).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Refinement:** Both files show a pattern of small, rapid changes to correct typos, refine logic, and integrate new features, particularly around error handling and logging.
*   **Logger (`fs_logger`) Integration:** There's a consistent effort to integrate `FSLogger.logWithTag` for debugging and tracing application flow, indicating a focus on observability.
*   **Cancellation Mechanism:** The `CancelableOperation` pattern is a central recurring element in the controller, highlighting the importance of managing ongoing asynchronous operations and providing cancellation capabilities.
*   **Simulated Testing:** The `UploadFileToItilUseCase` was modified to consistently throw an exception, suggesting that these changes were part of developing and testing the error handling and retry logic in the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController`.

## 12:19:14 PM
The changes primarily affect two files related to attachment handling within a Freshservice Flutter application's form library.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`**
    This file, `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController`, is responsible for managing the logic of ITIL attachment uploads, including handling multiple attachments in parallel, retries, and removal.
    *   **Initial Implementation (10/26/2025, 11:29:53 AM):** The controller was set up to perform parallel uploads, with each successful or failed upload updating its state individually within a `Map` that was then emitted via `onModelChanged`.
    *   **Logging Refinements (10/26/2025, 11:31:51 AM and 11:31:57 AM):** A specific logger tag `"siderfight"` was introduced for upload error messages, which was quickly corrected to `"siderfighter"`.
    *   **State Management Evolution (10/26/2025, 12:01:18 PM):** A significant change introduced a `sharedStateMap` to accumulate the upload results from all parallel operations. This allowed `onModelChanged` to be called with a comprehensive, aggregated state map after each individual attachment completed its upload, reflecting the progress of all attachments rather than just the one that just finished.
    *   **Oscillation and Reversion (Multiple Timestamps: 12:07:47 AM, 12:07:53 PM, 12:09:45 PM, 12:09:51 PM, 12:13:49 PM):** The `sharedStateMap` approach was repeatedly introduced and then reverted back to the original method of updating individual attachment states. This suggests an iterative process of testing or refining the parallel upload state management. For instance, at 12:13:49 PM, it reverted to the individual update logic and temporarily changed the error log tag back to `_tag`.
    *   **Final State (10/26/2025, 12:14:05 PM):** The code ultimately settled back on the `sharedStateMap` approach for accumulated upload results and restored the `"siderfighter"` tag for error logging, indicating that the cumulative state update was the desired final behavior.

2.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`**
    This file, `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField`, is a Flutter `StatefulWidget` responsible for the UI presentation of an ITIL attachment field, integrating with the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController`.
    *   **Initial Implementation (10/26/2025, 11:33:50 AM):** The widget was implemented to display an attachment button, show attachment previews, and handle user interactions (add, remove, retry). It initializes the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` and listens to its `onModelChanged` callback to update the UI.
    *   **Logging Adjustments (Multiple Timestamps: 12:12:10 PM, 12:12:19 PM, 12:12:50 PM):** A series of minor changes were made to a specific logging statement within the `_FSFormItemItilAttachmentFieldState`'s `onModelChanged` callback. Initially, it attempted to log `updatedModel`, then `updatedMod`, then `updatedModel.uplo` (likely typos), and finally corrected to `updatedModel.uploadResultMap.values` for accurate debugging of the attachment upload states.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/26/2025, 11:29:53 AM:** Initial implementation of the attachment upload controller.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:33:50 AM:** Initial implementation of the attachment field UI widget.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:01:18 PM:** Introduction of the `sharedStateMap` for accumulated parallel upload results in the controller, marking a key shift in state management strategy.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:12:50 PM:** Final correction and refinement of a debugging log message in the UI widget.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:14:05 PM:** The final recorded state for the controller, solidifying the use of `sharedStateMap` for cumulative state updates.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **"siderfighter" Log Tag:** The string `"siderfighter"` is a recurring element, consistently used as a specific tag for `FSLogger` statements, particularly for error reporting in the attachment upload controller. This likely serves as a unique identifier for filtering logs related to this feature.
*   **Iterative State Management:** There is a notable pattern of back-and-forth changes in `fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart` regarding the handling of parallel upload states. The `sharedStateMap` approach for accumulating and emitting full state updates was introduced, then reverted multiple times, and finally reinstated. This suggests an active development process involving experimentation or debugging of the best way to manage and communicate asynchronous state changes.
*   **Incremental Debugging Refinement:** In the UI file, the quick succession of changes to a single logging statement to correctly display `updatedModel.uploadResultMap.values` highlights an iterative process of refining debugging output.
