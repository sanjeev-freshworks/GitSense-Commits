# Activity Summary for 10/26/2025

## 12:40:56 AM
The provided log details changes exclusively to the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`. This file appears to manage attachment uploads within a Freshservice Flutter application, specifically for ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) related forms.

**Key Changes and Timestamps:**

*   **10/25/2025, 11:55:34 PM - 10/26/2025, 12:06:04 AM (Initial Cancellation Mechanism Refinement):** This period shows a focused effort on refining the attachment upload cancellation logic.
    *   Initially, the `_ongoingUploads` map stored `CancelableOperation` objects from the `async` package.
    *   Between 11:55:34 PM and 11:59:43 PM, the exception handling for cancellation within `_uploadFilesParallely` evolved from `CanceledException` to `CancellationException`, then `CancelableOperationCanceledError`, and finally `Cancel`. This suggests a struggle to identify the correct cancellation exception type from the `async` package.
    *   At 10/26/2025, 12:02:56 AM, the `try-on-catch` block was refactored. Instead of specific cancellation exceptions, a generic `catch (error)` block was introduced. Inside this block, `cancelableOperation.isCanceled` was checked to differentiate between a cancellation and a general upload failure. This robust change handles cancellation more reliably within the generic error handler.
    *   The `removeAttachment` and `dispose` methods consistently used `_cancelUpload` and `_cancelAllUploads` respectively, which relied on the `CancelableOperation.cancel()` method.

*   **10/26/2025, 12:22:48 AM - 10/26/2025, 12:36:08 AM (Shift to `Completer` for Cancellation):** A significant architectural change occurred here, moving away from `CancelableOperation` to Dart's native `Completer` for managing and signaling cancellations.
    *   At 10/26/2025, 12:22:48 AM, the `import 'package:async/async.dart';` was removed, and `import 'dart:async';` was added. Correspondingly, `_ongoingUploads` (Map<AttachmentLocalFile, CancelableOperation>) was replaced with `_uploadCompleters` (Map<AttachmentLocalFile, Completer<void>>).
    *   The `_uploadFilesParallely` method was updated to create a `Completer` for each attachment and store it. The `await _uploadFileToItilUseCase!.call(attachment)` call was no longer wrapped in a `CancelableOperation`. Instead, a check `if (completer.isCompleted)` was introduced *after* the `await` call to see if a cancellation was requested mid-upload.
    *   The `removeAttachment` and `dispose` methods were updated to interact with `_uploadCompleters`. Instead of calling `cancel()` on a `CancelableOperation`, they now call `completer.complete()` or `completer.completeError()` on the `Completer` to signal cancellation. There were a few iterative changes in how `dispose` handled `complete()` vs `completeError()`, eventually settling on `completer.complete()` at 12:36:08 AM.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Logging:** `FSLogger.logWithTag(_tag, ...)` is used extensively throughout the controller to log attachment upload progress, states, and errors.
*   **Immutability and `copyWith`:** The controller consistently updates its model (`FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`) by creating new instances using `getCurrentModel().copyWith(...)` and then calling `onModelChanged()`. This pattern suggests a Redux-like or BLoC-like state management approach where state objects are immutable.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The `UploadFileToItilUseCase` is injected into the controller, with a fallback to `fsDIComponent.get<UploadFileToItilUseCase>()`, indicating a dependency injection framework is in use.
*   **Parallel Processing:** The `_uploadFilesParallely` method, which utilizes `Future.wait(uploadFutures)`, clearly indicates an intention for attachments to be uploaded concurrently.
*   **Attachment State Management:** The controller manages the state of each attachment upload (`AttachmentUploadStateInProgress`, `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess`, `AttachmentUploadStateError`) and updates a map (`uploadResultMap`) within the UI model.
*   **Retry Mechanism:** A `retryUpload` function is present, which re-initiates an upload for a specific file, clearing any previous ongoing upload for that file.
*   **Clean-up on Dispose:** The `dispose` method consistently includes logic to cancel all ongoing uploads and nullify the `_uploadFileToItilUseCase` to prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior.
