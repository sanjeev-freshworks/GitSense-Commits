# Activity Summary for 10/26/2025

## 12:40:56 AM
The provided log details changes exclusively to the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`. This file appears to manage attachment uploads within a Freshservice Flutter application, specifically for ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) related forms.

**Key Changes and Timestamps:**

*   **10/25/2025, 11:55:34 PM - 10/26/2025, 12:06:04 AM (Initial Cancellation Mechanism Refinement):** This period shows a focused effort on refining the attachment upload cancellation logic.
    *   Initially, the `_ongoingUploads` map stored `CancelableOperation` objects from the `async` package.
    *   Between 11:55:34 PM and 11:59:43 PM, the exception handling for cancellation within `_uploadFilesParallely` evolved from `CanceledException` to `CancellationException`, then `CancelableOperationCanceledError`, and finally `Cancel`. This suggests a struggle to identify the correct cancellation exception type from the `async` package.
    *   At 10/26/2025, 12:02:56 AM, the `try-on-catch` block was refactored. Instead of specific cancellation exceptions, a generic `catch (error)` block was introduced. Inside this block, `cancelableOperation.isCanceled` was checked to differentiate between a cancellation and a general upload failure. This robust change handles cancellation more reliably within the generic error handler.
    *   The `removeAttachment` and `dispose` methods consistently used `_cancelUpload` and `_cancelAllUploads` respectively, which relied on the `CancelableOperation.cancel()` method.

*   **10/26/2025, 12:22:48 AM - 10/26/2025, 12:36:08 AM (Shift to `Completer` for Cancellation):** A significant architectural change occurred here, moving away from `CancelableOperation` to Dart's native `Completer` for managing and signaling cancellations.
    *   At 10/26/2025, 12:22:48 AM, the `import 'package:async/async.dart';` was removed, and `import 'dart:async';` was added. Correspondingly, `_ongoingUploads` (Map<AttachmentLocalFile, CancelableOperation>) was replaced with `_uploadCompleters` (Map<AttachmentLocalFile, Completer<void>>).
    *   The `_uploadFilesParallely` method was updated to create a `Completer` for each attachment and store it. The `await _uploadFileToItilUseCase!.call(attachment)` call was no longer wrapped in a `CancelableOperation`. Instead, a check `if (completer.isCompleted)` was introduced *after* the `await` call to see if a cancellation was requested mid-upload.
    *   The `removeAttachment` and `dispose` methods were updated to interact with `_uploadCompleters`. Instead of calling `cancel()` on a `CancelableOperation`, they now call `completer.complete()` or `completer.completeError()` on the `Completer` to signal cancellation. There were a few iterative changes in how `dispose` handled `complete()` vs `completeError()`, eventually settling on `completer.complete()` at 12:36:08 AM.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Logging:** `FSLogger.logWithTag(_tag, ...)` is used extensively throughout the controller to log attachment upload progress, states, and errors.
*   **Immutability and `copyWith`:** The controller consistently updates its model (`FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`) by creating new instances using `getCurrentModel().copyWith(...)` and then calling `onModelChanged()`. This pattern suggests a Redux-like or BLoC-like state management approach where state objects are immutable.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The `UploadFileToItilUseCase` is injected into the controller, with a fallback to `fsDIComponent.get<UploadFileToItilUseCase>()`, indicating a dependency injection framework is in use.
*   **Parallel Processing:** The `_uploadFilesParallely` method, which utilizes `Future.wait(uploadFutures)`, clearly indicates an intention for attachments to be uploaded concurrently.
*   **Attachment State Management:** The controller manages the state of each attachment upload (`AttachmentUploadStateInProgress`, `AttachmentUploadStateSuccess`, `AttachmentUploadStateError`) and updates a map (`uploadResultMap`) within the UI model.
*   **Retry Mechanism:** A `retryUpload` function is present, which re-initiates an upload for a specific file, clearing any previous ongoing upload for that file.
*   **Clean-up on Dispose:** The `dispose` method consistently includes logic to cancel all ongoing uploads and nullify the `_uploadFileToItilUseCase` to prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

## 4:13:51 AM
The provided log details a series of closely timed code changes on October 26, 2025, focusing primarily on enhancing attachment handling within a Flutter Freshservice application's form library.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart` (Timestamp: 10/26/2025, 12:47:30 AM)**
    *   A new controller, `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController`, was introduced.
    *   This controller manages the upload of attachments to ITIL, including parallel uploads, tracking upload states (InProgress, Success, Error), and handling file cancellation and removal.
    *   It uses a `Map<AttachmentLocalFile, Completer<void>>` to manage ongoing upload tasks, enabling robust cancellation logic.
    *   It interacts with `UploadFileToItilUseCase` for the actual upload business logic and uses `onModelChanged` to update the UI model with attachment states.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/fields/form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model.dart` (Multiple timestamps between 10/26/2025, 12:53:35 AM and 12:54:31 AM)**
    *   This UI model, `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`, was significantly refined.
    *   Initially, it defined properties like `uploadResultMap` and `attachments` to hold upload states and local files.
    *   Later updates involved implementing or clarifying inherited abstract methods from `FormFieldUIModel`:
        *   `getFieldValueForConditionValidation()` was initially unimplemented, then changed to return `null` with a comment indicating that conditions cannot be added to attachment fields (10/26/2025, 12:54:12 AM).
        *   The `hasValue` getter was implemented to check if the `attachments` list is not empty (10/26/2025, 12:54:31 AM).
    *   Minor constructor adjustments were made for `attachments` and `isShowAttachmentPicker` initialization.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/validator/common_form_field_validator.dart` (Multiple timestamps between 10/26/2025, 12:55:21 AM and 12:58:30 AM)**
    *   The central `CommonFormFieldValidator` underwent several changes to accommodate the new `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel`.
    *   Initially, the validator explicitly threw an `UnimplementedError` for this new model type (10/26/2025, 12:55:21 AM).
    *   It then transitioned through using a general attachment validator (`_attachmentFieldValidator`), to attempting an incorrect nested validator call (passing `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateFieldValidator` as an argument to `_attachmentFieldValidator.validate`), and finally correctly integrating a dedicated validator.
    *   A new private field, `_attachmentWithUploadStateFieldValidator` of type `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateFieldValidator`, was added to the `CommonFormFieldValidator` class (10/26/2025, 12:56:40 AM).
    *   The `switch` statement within the `validate` method was updated to correctly use this new dedicated validator for `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` (10/26/2025, 12:57:42 AM).
    *   Comments indicating `TODO: Handle this case` were removed, and descriptive comments were added.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/di/form_lib_ui_fields_module.dart` (Timestamp: 10/26/2025, 12:57:26 AM)**
    *   The Dependency Injection (DI) module was updated.
    *   `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateFieldValidator` was registered as a factory with `fsDIComponent`.
    *   The factory registration for `CommonFormFieldValidator` was modified to inject an instance of the newly registered `FormAttachmentWithUploadStateFieldValidator` into its constructor.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/src/view/common/components/attachment/attachment_item_card.dart` (Timestamp: 10/26/2025, 12:59:14 AM)**
    *   The `AttachmentItemCard` UI component was enhanced.
    *   A new `isUploadFailed` boolean property was added to visually indicate a failed upload state.
    *   The card's border color now dynamically changes to an error-mild color if `isUploadFailed` is true, providing visual feedback to the user.
    *   Tapping functionality via `InkWell` is conditionally applied, excluding cases where the upload has failed.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/model/form_field_ui_model.dart` (Timestamp: 10/26/2025, 1:10:24 AM)**
    *   The base `FormFieldUIModel` file was updated to include new `part` declarations for `form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model.dart` and `form_attachment_preview_field_ui_model.dart`, signifying their integration into the core form field structure.
    *   Abstract getters `hasValue` and `getFieldValueForConditionValidation()` were formally defined in the `FormFieldUIModel` sealed class, ensuring all implementing classes provide these.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Attachment Feature Development:** A clear pattern is the dedicated development of a robust attachment handling feature, spanning from UI models to controllers and validators.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Changes in the `form_attachment_with_upload_result_ui_model.dart` and `common_form_field_validator.dart` files show an iterative process of initially adding placeholders or basic implementations, followed by detailed refinements and corrections.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The use of `part` files for UI models and separate validator classes (`FormAttachmentWithUploadStateFieldValidator`) highlights a modular approach.
*   **Dependency Injection (DI):** `fsDIComponent` is consistently used to register and retrieve dependencies, ensuring maintainable and testable code.
*   **UI Feedback:** The `AttachmentItemCard` update demonstrates attention to user experience by providing visual cues for attachment upload status.
*   **Rapid Development:** All modifications occurred within a concise timeframe on the same day, indicating a focused effort on this particular feature set.

## 10:18:40 AM
On 10/26/2025 at 10:16:10 AM, a significant update was made to the file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`. This file introduces the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` class, a Dart controller designed to manage the upload lifecycle of ITIL attachments within a Flutter application.

Key updates and functionalities include:

*   **ITIL Attachment Upload Management:** The controller handles the end-to-end process of uploading attachments specifically for ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) contexts, utilizing an injected `UploadFileToItilUseCase`.
*   **Concurrent and Cancellable Uploads:** It features `_uploadFilesParallely` which allows multiple attachments to be uploaded concurrently. A crucial enhancement is the implementation of `CancelableOperation` from the `async` package, enabling the cancellation of individual or all ongoing uploads, significantly improving user experience.
*   **Robust State Management:** The controller interacts with a `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` to update the UI state. It provides `onModelChanged` and `getCurrentModel` callbacks to reflect various upload states: `InProgress`, `Success`, `Error`, and handles `CanceledException`.
*   **Comprehensive Lifecycle Operations:** Methods are available for initiating new uploads (`uploadFile`), retrying failed ones (`retryUpload`), removing attachments (`removeAttachment`), and disposing of the controller (`dispose`) which includes canceling all pending uploads.
*   **Error and Cancellation Handling:** The code explicitly differentiates between upload errors and cancellations, ensuring the UI model is updated correctly in each scenario. When an upload is cancelled, the attachment is removed from the pending list.
*   **Logging:** Extensive use of `FSLogger` with a consistent `_tag` (`FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController`) is present throughout the class for detailed logging of operations, progress, and errors.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The `UploadFileToItilUseCase` is obtained via `fsDIComponent.get`, indicating a dependency injection pattern for business logic.

Overall, this change introduces a robust and user-friendly mechanism for handling ITIL attachment uploads, focusing on concurrency, cancellability, and clear state management.

## 11:18:56 AM
The provided logs detail changes across two Dart files primarily related to attachment upload functionality within a Freshservice mobile application. The overall theme revolves around enhancing attachment upload robustness, cancellation, and error handling.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`**

This file, `fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`, underwent significant iterative development focusing on the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` class.
*   **Initial state (10/26/2025, 10:20:55 AM)**: The controller was established to manage parallel attachment uploads using `CancelableOperation` from the `async` package, with capabilities for initiating uploads, retrying, removing attachments, and cancelling individual or all ongoing uploads. It interacts with a `UploadFileToItilUseCase` and updates a UI model via callbacks.
*   **Early refinements (10:21 AM - 10:23 AM)**: Minor code formatting and comment additions were observed, along with a brief period (10:22:43 AM - 10:22:52 AM) where a syntax error (`..valu`) was introduced and subsequently fixed (10:23:18 AM).
*   **CanceledException definition (10:29 AM - 10:31 AM)**: A custom `CanceledException` class was defined. This process involved several small corrections:
    *   Initial incomplete attempts (10:29:43 AM, 10:29:50 AM).
    *   Proper definition with a message and `toString()` override (10:29:59 AM).
    *   Brief simplification (10:30:16 AM).
    *   An accidental misnaming as `InvalidPageException` in its internal implementation (10:31:27 AM), which was quickly corrected (10:31:38 AM).
    *   Addition of `const` to the `CanceledException` constructor (10:31:48 AM).
*   **Enhanced cancellation logic (10/26/2025, 10:32:14 AM)**: A crucial update added an `onCancel` callback to `CancelableOperation.fromFuture`. This callback explicitly logs the cancellation and throws the custom `CanceledException`, ensuring proper propagation of cancellation events within the upload process.
*   **Retry for failed uploads (10/26/2025, 10:50:17 AM)**: New methods were introduced to provide more comprehensive retry functionality: `retryAllFailedUploads()`, `getFailedAttachments()`, and `hasFailedAttachments()`. This allows users to re-attempt all uploads that previously encountered an error.
*   **Minor code reordering (10:51:44 AM - 10:51:59 AM)**: A temporary reordering of the `_ongoingUploads.remove(attachment)` call for successful uploads was introduced and then reverted shortly after, indicating a review of the exact timing of state updates.

**File: `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/domain/usecase/upload_file_to_itil_use_case.dart`**

This file, `upload_file_to_itil_use_case.dart`, defines the `UploadFileToItilUseCase` responsible for the actual file upload logic.
*   **Initial placeholder (10/26/2025, 10:58:19 AM)**: The `protectedExecute` method, which contains the core logic, was initially empty.
*   **Simulated failure (10:58:39 AM - 10:58:50 AM)**: The `protectedExecute` method was updated to simulate an upload failure by introducing a 3-second delay followed by throwing a generic `Exception('Hello exception')`. The `async` keyword was correctly added to the method signature in a subsequent commit (10:58:50 AM). This change was likely for testing the error handling and retry mechanisms implemented in the controller.
*   **Logging integration (10:59:53 AM - 11:01:04 AM)**: Logging was progressively added to this use case:
    *   Initial attempt to log (10:59:53 AM) without a proper `fs_logger` import.
    *   A temporary incorrect import (11:00:01 AM) aliasing `dart:math` as `FSLogger`, which was then used in the log call (11:00:13 AM).
    *   The incorrect import was removed (11:00:37 AM) and then the correct `package:fs_logger/fs_logger.dart` was imported (11:00:45 AM).
    *   The logging message was slightly adjusted to log the entire `AttachmentLocalFile` object (11:01:04 AM).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Refinement:** Both files show a pattern of small, rapid changes to correct typos, refine logic, and integrate new features, particularly around error handling and logging.
*   **Logger (`fs_logger`) Integration:** There's a consistent effort to integrate `FSLogger.logWithTag` for debugging and tracing application flow, indicating a focus on observability.
*   **Cancellation Mechanism:** The `CancelableOperation` pattern is a central recurring element in the controller, highlighting the importance of managing ongoing asynchronous operations and providing cancellation capabilities.
*   **Simulated Testing:** The `UploadFileToItilUseCase` was modified to consistently throw an exception, suggesting that these changes were part of developing and testing the error handling and retry logic in the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController`.

## 12:19:14 PM
The changes primarily affect two files related to attachment handling within a Freshservice Flutter application's form library.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`**
    This file, `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController`, is responsible for managing the logic of ITIL attachment uploads, including handling multiple attachments in parallel, retries, and removal.
    *   **Initial Implementation (10/26/2025, 11:29:53 AM):** The controller was set up to perform parallel uploads, with each successful or failed upload updating its state individually within a `Map` that was then emitted via `onModelChanged`.
    *   **Logging Refinements (10/26/2025, 11:31:51 AM and 11:31:57 AM):** A specific logger tag `"siderfight"` was introduced for upload error messages, which was quickly corrected to `"siderfighter"`.
    *   **State Management Evolution (10/26/2025, 12:01:18 PM):** A significant change introduced a `sharedStateMap` to accumulate the upload results from all parallel operations. This allowed `onModelChanged` to be called with a comprehensive, aggregated state map after each individual attachment completed its upload, reflecting the progress of all attachments rather than just the one that just finished.
    *   **Oscillation and Reversion (Multiple Timestamps: 12:07:47 AM, 12:07:53 PM, 12:09:45 PM, 12:09:51 PM, 12:13:49 PM):** The `sharedStateMap` approach was repeatedly introduced and then reverted back to the original method of updating individual attachment states. This suggests an iterative process of testing or refining the parallel upload state management. For instance, at 12:13:49 PM, it reverted to the individual update logic and temporarily changed the error log tag back to `_tag`.
    *   **Final State (10/26/2025, 12:14:05 PM):** The code ultimately settled back on the `sharedStateMap` approach for accumulated upload results and restored the `"siderfighter"` tag for error logging, indicating that the cumulative state update was the desired final behavior.

2.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`**
    This file, `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField`, is a Flutter `StatefulWidget` responsible for the UI presentation of an ITIL attachment field, integrating with the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController`.
    *   **Initial Implementation (10/26/2025, 11:33:50 AM):** The widget was implemented to display an attachment button, show attachment previews, and handle user interactions (add, remove, retry). It initializes the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` and listens to its `onModelChanged` callback to update the UI.
    *   **Logging Adjustments (Multiple Timestamps: 12:12:10 PM, 12:12:19 PM, 12:12:50 PM):** A series of minor changes were made to a specific logging statement within the `_FSFormItemItilAttachmentFieldState`'s `onModelChanged` callback. Initially, it attempted to log `updatedModel`, then `updatedMod`, then `updatedModel.uplo` (likely typos), and finally corrected to `updatedModel.uploadResultMap.values` for accurate debugging of the attachment upload states.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/26/2025, 11:29:53 AM:** Initial implementation of the attachment upload controller.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:33:50 AM:** Initial implementation of the attachment field UI widget.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:01:18 PM:** Introduction of the `sharedStateMap` for accumulated parallel upload results in the controller, marking a key shift in state management strategy.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:12:50 PM:** Final correction and refinement of a debugging log message in the UI widget.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:14:05 PM:** The final recorded state for the controller, solidifying the use of `sharedStateMap` for cumulative state updates.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **"siderfighter" Log Tag:** The string `"siderfighter"` is a recurring element, consistently used as a specific tag for `FSLogger` statements, particularly for error reporting in the attachment upload controller. This likely serves as a unique identifier for filtering logs related to this feature.
*   **Iterative State Management:** There is a notable pattern of back-and-forth changes in `fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart` regarding the handling of parallel upload states. The `sharedStateMap` approach for accumulating and emitting full state updates was introduced, then reverted multiple times, and finally reinstated. This suggests an active development process involving experimentation or debugging of the best way to manage and communicate asynchronous state changes.
*   **Incremental Debugging Refinement:** In the UI file, the quick succession of changes to a single logging statement to correctly display `updatedModel.uploadResultMap.values` highlights an iterative process of refining debugging output.

## 1:19:16 PM
The code changes primarily focus on two related files concerning attachment upload functionality and their corresponding unit tests:

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`**
    *   **12:20 PM - 12:29 PM**: Initial changes focused on refining the state management during parallel file uploads (`_uploadFilesParallely`). This included adjusting how the `getCurrentModel()` was used or passed as a parameter (`currentModel`) to ensure consistency and prevent stale state issues during rapid UI updates.
    *   **12:55:06 PM**: A significant refactoring introduced robust cancellation logic using `CancelableOperation` from the `async` package. This involved adding a `_ongoingUploads` map to track operations, new `_cancelUpload` and `_cancelAllUploads` methods, and specific error handling for `CanceledException`.
    *   **12:55:16 PM**: The cancellation logic introduced at 12:55:06 PM was temporarily reverted, suggesting a rollback or re-evaluation.
    *   **12:57:46 PM**: The `CancelableOperation` based cancellation logic was re-introduced and further refined, providing explicit handling for `CanceledException`.
    *   **1:05:24 PM - 1:05:38 PM**: Minor adjustments were made to the `uploadFile` and `retryUpload` methods concerning whether they `await` the completion of parallel uploads. The final change reverted `uploadFile` to not `await` `_uploadFilesParallely`, implying that the initial "in-progress" state is emitted, and further updates are handled asynchronously without blocking the caller.

2.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`**
    *   **12:32 PM - 12:43 PM**: The main focus here was on managing the local UI model state (`_currModel`) within the `_FSFormItemItilAttachmentFieldState`. This was done to ensure the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` always receives the most up-to-date model state, especially when asynchronous upload callbacks might occur faster than Flutter's widget rebuild cycle. There was some experimentation with `setState()` versus solely relying on `widget.onChanged` for updates, ultimately settling on updating `_currModel` locally and then calling `widget.onChanged`.

3.  **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/test/ui/bloc/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller_test.dart`**
    *   **1:08 PM - 1:16 PM**: This file was introduced and continuously refined throughout the session, adding comprehensive unit tests for the `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController`. These tests cover various scenarios for `uploadFile` (single/multiple, success/error, retry behavior) and `removeAttachment` (including cancellation during upload). Recurring additions of `await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 10));` indicate efforts to stabilize asynchronous tests by allowing time for operations to complete.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/26/2025, 12:22:40 PM**: Initial refactoring for internal state consistency in the attachment upload controller.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:33:51 PM**: Introduction of local state management (`_currModel`) in the attachment field UI for better state synchronization.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:55:06 PM**: Major implementation of upload cancellation using `CancelableOperation`.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:57:46 PM**: Re-introduction and refinement of cancellation logic after a temporary rollback.
*   **10/26/2025, 1:08:37 PM**: Creation of the unit test file for the attachment upload controller.
*   **10/26/2025, 1:09:24 PM - 1:16:24 PM**: Continuous updates to tests, mainly adding delays to accommodate asynchronous behavior.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Asynchronous State Management**: A strong pattern of tackling complexities related to asynchronous operations and maintaining consistent state across different layers (controller, UI model, UI widget).
*   **Cancellation Handling**: The introduction and refinement of explicit upload cancellation mechanisms indicate a focus on improving user experience and resource management.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: Both the controller and UI files show multiple small changes over short periods, demonstrating an iterative approach to development and debugging, especially concerning state synchronization and async behavior.
*   **Robust Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests were developed alongside the feature, with a particular emphasis on ensuring tests for asynchronous operations are stable, often by adding explicit delays.
*   **Logger Usage**: `FSLogger.logWithTag` is extensively used across both files for debugging and tracing the flow of events and state changes.
*   **`copyWith` Pattern**: The use of `copyWith` on UI models is a consistent pattern for immutably updating parts of the model and emitting new states.

## 2:18:53 PM
The log entries detail changes across several Dart files, primarily focusing on attachment handling, form validation, and UI state management within a Flutter application for Freshservice. The changes span from October 26, 2025, from 1:24 PM to 2:18 PM, indicating a concentrated development effort.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/di/journey_lib_di_module.dart`** (10/26/2025, 1:24:01 PM):
    *   This file, a DI (Dependency Injection) module for `journey_lib`, had `fsDIComponent.allowReassignment` set to `true`.
    *   It registers various modules including `HttpClientModule`, `CommonTestModule`, `UserLibModule`, `CommonBusinessLibModule`, `SupportPortalLibModule`, `FormLibModule`, `JourneyLibModule`, and `JourneyLibTestDataModule`. This indicates the setup of dependencies for testing the journey library.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/activity_form/journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart`** (10/26/2025, 1:24:32 PM & 1:24:41 PM):
    *   This Flutter widget is responsible for rendering the activity form content within the journey detail screen.
    *   It handles scrolling to specific form fields when an event is received via `FSScrollToFormFieldNotifier`.
    *   It builds different types of form fields (section fields, attachment fields, common fields) using a `switch` statement based on their UI model type.
    *   The two entries on this file are identical, suggesting a minor save or reformat without functional changes.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`** (Multiple entries between 1:36:01 PM and 2:09:53 PM):
    *   This controller manages the upload, retry, and removal of attachments for ITIL forms.
    *   It uses `UploadFileToItilUseCase` for the actual upload logic and `CancelableOperation` to manage ongoing uploads, allowing for cancellation.
    *   **Key changes over time:**
        *   Initial implementation included `_ongoingUploads` to track and cancel operations, `uploadFile` for handling new attachments (including setting `InProgress` states), `_uploadFilesParallely` for parallel uploads, `retryUpload`, `removeAttachment`, `_cancelUpload`, `_cancelAllUploads`, and `dispose`.
        *   Around 1:39 PM, a change made `_uploadFilesParallely(newAttachments)` non-awaited, meaning it would run in the background without blocking the `uploadFile` method.
        *   From 1:40:09 PM, `Future.microtask` was introduced in `uploadFile` before calling `_uploadFilesParallely` and in `_uploadFilesParallely` after an upload completes (for `onModelChanged`) and when an error occurs. This aims to ensure UI state updates happen in the next microtask tick, potentially resolving rendering issues due to rapid state changes.
        *   Several changes between 2:07 PM and 2:08 PM introduced an internal `_currentModel` state variable within the controller and a `_updateModel` helper method. The `getCurrentModel` callback from the widget was used to initialize `_currentModel`, and a `syncModel` method was added. This suggests an attempt to manage the attachment model state more reliably within the controller itself, rather than solely relying on the parent widget's `getCurrentModel` callback, which could lead to stale data if the parent widget updates slowly. The log also shows the `_currentModel` being used in `_getCurrentModel()` and `_updateModel()` to ensure consistency.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`** (Multiple entries between 1:36:31 PM and 2:06:32 PM):
    *   This Flutter widget represents an individual attachment field in a form.
    *   It creates and manages an `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` to handle attachment logic.
    *   It displays a button to "Attach Files" and an `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot` to show current attachments and their upload states.
    *   **Key changes over time:**
        *   Initially, the `_currModel` (later renamed `_currentModel`) was introduced and commented out, intended to hold the current model state to address issues where `onChanged()` might be too slow.
        *   At 1:52:07 PM, `_currModel` was uncommented and actively used, and `getCurrentModel` in the controller was updated to return `_currModel`.
        *   Further changes (1:57:02 PM, 1:57:30 PM, 1:57:37 PM) experimented with wrapping `widget.onChanged(updatedModel)` in a `Future.microtask` within the `onModelChanged` callback of the controller, trying to resolve UI update timing issues. This was later reverted or replaced with the controller managing its own `_currentModel`.
        *   Around 2:05 PM, the `_currentModel` was re-enabled and its usage solidified. The `didUpdateWidget` lifecycle method was added to sync `_currentModel` with `widget.model` when the widget's model changes.
        *   The `build` method was updated to use `_currentModel` for various UI elements (e.g., button text, enabled state, attachment preview) instead of `widget.model`, reflecting the controller's internal state management. This change was eventually rolled back implicitly as the later version of the file (2:06:32 PM) uses `widget.model` again, suggesting the internal model management in the controller was refined instead of in the widget itself.
        *   The final changes in this file revert some of the `_currentModel` usage in the `build` method back to `widget.model`, indicating a different approach to state synchronization was adopted, potentially relying more on the controller to manage and notify changes effectively.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_business/lib/src/domain/usecase/upload_file_to_itil_use_case.dart`** (10/26/2025, 1:38:08 PM):
    *   This file defines a use case for uploading files to ITIL.
    *   Crucially, this version explicitly `await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 2))` and then `throw Exception('Hello exception')`. This temporary code was likely added for testing error handling scenarios, simulating a failed upload after a delay.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/bloc/journey_form_detail_bloc.dart`** (10/26/2025, 2:18:24 PM):
    *   This Bloc handles the business logic for the Journey Form Detail screen.
    *   It processes various UI events related to form fields, navigation, and submission.
    *   It uses `JourneyFormDetailUIMapper`, `JourneyActivityFormValidator`, and `JourneyServiceItemFormValidator`.
    *   The code includes handling for activity form validation, service item form validation, and submitting forms (both data fields and service item fields).
    *   It also manages navigation states (e.g., opening bottom sheets, downloading attachments, finishing the screen) and user messages (e.g., showing errors).
    *   A significant part of the code involves managing `JourneyFormSteps` for multi-step form flows and updating the UI state accordingly.
    *   The `_onActivityFormFieldUIModelChanged` and `_onServiceItemFormFieldUIModelChanged` methods indicate that individual form field changes trigger updates to the form's overall UI state.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **10/26/2025, 1:38:08 PM:** Introduction of simulated error and delay in `UploadFileToItilUseCase` for testing.
*   **10/26/2025, 1:40:09 PM:** Introduction of `Future.microtask` for UI state updates in `fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart` to address potential UI rendering issues.
*   **10/26/2025, 1:52:07 PM:** Attempt to use an internal `_currentModel` in `fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart` to manage state more directly, rather than relying solely on `widget.model`.
*   **10/26/2025, 2:05:11 PM:** Addition of `didUpdateWidget` to `fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart` to sync the internal `_currentModel` with `widget.model`.
*   **10/26/2025, 2:05:21 PM - 2:05:44 PM:** Further adjustments in `fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart` to consistently use `_currentModel` for UI elements.
*   **10/26/2025, 2:06:23 PM - 2:06:32 PM:** Reversion of `_currentModel` usage in `fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`'s build method back to `widget.model`, suggesting a shift in state management strategy.
*   **10/26/2025, 2:07:22 PM - 2:08:49 PM:** Significant refactoring in `fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart` to properly introduce and utilize an internal `_currentModel` and `_updateModel` helper, ensuring consistent state updates and reducing reliance on the `getCurrentModel` callback. A `syncModel` method was also added.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Flutter Widget and Bloc Development:** The log shows typical Flutter development patterns with `StatefulWidget`s, `State` classes, `Provider` for dependency injection (or context reading), `Bloc` for state management, and `UseCase` for business logic.
*   **Attachment Handling:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around robust attachment upload, cancellation, retry, and removal, indicating a complex feature in active development or bug fixing. The use of `CancelableOperation` highlights an effort to manage asynchronous tasks efficiently.
*   **State Management:** There's a clear pattern of refining state management, especially for attachment uploads. The evolution from using direct widget properties to introducing internal controller state (`_currModel`/`_currentModel`) and then explicitly handling synchronization (`didUpdateWidget`, `_updateModel`, `syncModel`) suggests challenges with asynchronous updates and ensuring UI consistency. The `Future.microtask` calls were also part of this effort to control the timing of state updates.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The `JourneyLibDIModuleTest` explicitly registers multiple modules with `fsDIComponent`, indicating a consistent use of DI across the application, especially for testing.
*   **Logging:** `FSLogger.logWithTag` is extensively used across all modified files, providing detailed tracing of execution flow, state changes, and error occurrences. This is a recurring pattern for debugging and monitoring.
*   **Error Handling:** Explicit `try-catch` blocks and `UCResult.when` for `UCSuccessResult`/`UCErrorResult` are used to manage success and error states from use cases, indicating a structured approach to error handling.
*   **Localization:** References to `context.commonUiLoc` suggest the application utilizes localization for user-facing text.
*   **UI Components:** Reusable UI components like `FSPlainButton`, `FSImage`, `AttachmentItemPreviewRoot`, and `FSAlertDialog` are consistently used, indicating a component-based UI architecture.
*   **Form Validation:** The `JourneyFormDetailBloc` includes validators (`JourneyActivityFormValidator`, `JourneyServiceItemFormValidator`) and handles validation results to guide user flow and display errors.

## 3:19:07 PM
The code changes primarily focus on refining attachment handling within a Freshservice Flutter mobile application, specifically related to journey forms. These updates occurred rapidly on October 26, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/presentation/bloc/journey_form_detail_bloc.dart`**
    *   **(10/26/2025, 2:19:14 PM - 2:19:47 PM)** A series of minor, iterative changes were made to the `_onActivityFormFieldUIModelChanged` method. Initially, a commented-out line for `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` was present, followed by its re-introduction. Subsequent changes refined the `FSLogger.logWithTag` statement, progressing from logging the raw `event.formFieldUIModel` to attempts at logging specific properties like `attachmentFieldUIModel.uploadResultMap.k` (likely a typo) and finally settling on `attachmentFieldUIModel.uploadResultMap.values` for better debugging insight.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/view/fields/attachment/fs_form_item_itil_attachment_field.dart`**
    *   **(10/26/2025, 2:27:46 PM - 2:28:22 PM)** This file underwent refactoring to introduce a new required callback parameter, `getCurrentModel`, to the `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` widget. This callback's purpose is to allow the internal `FSFormItilAttachmentUploadController` to retrieve the most up-to-date `FormAttachmentWithUploadResultUIModel` state. The changes show the sequential addition of the parameter declaration, its inclusion in the constructor, and finally its correct implementation within the `_controller`'s `initState`.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/src/ui/form_detail/view/components/activity_form/journey_form_detail_activity_form_content.dart`**
    *   **(10/26/2025, 2:28:37 PM - 2:30:18 PM)** This file saw significant revisions in how `_buildAttachmentField` provides the `getCurrentModel` callback to `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField`. Initially, it attempted to use a local `getFormFieldUIModel` (which returned null). Through several rapid, in-progress adjustments (including incomplete code snippets like `context.read<>();` and `bloc.state.`), it evolved to explicitly fetch the attachment field's current model directly from the `JourneyFormDetailBloc`'s state: `bloc.contentState?.journeyFormSteps.activityFormUIModel!.formFields[attachmentField.name]`. This ensures the attachment field receives real-time state updates from the Bloc.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/form_lib/lib/src/ui/fields/presentation/controller/fs_form_itil_attachment_upload_controller.dart`**
    *   **(10/26/2025, 2:35:11 PM - 2:35:36 PM)** The `uploadFile` method was refined to correctly update the UI model with `AttachmentUploadStateInProgress` for new attachments. An initial attempt had a partial variable reference (`cur`) which was quickly corrected to `currModel`.
    *   **(10/26/2025, 2:40:22 PM - 2:40:47 PM)** Within `_uploadFilesParallely`, there was a brief period where the `async` keyword was removed from the `newAttachments.map` callback, leading to invalid `await` calls. This was rapidly corrected, restoring the `async` keyword to ensure proper asynchronous execution of attachment uploads.

*   **`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/test/data/di/journey_lib_test_data_module.dart`**
    *   **(10/26/2025, 2:54:27 PM - 2:55:03 PM)** This file remained unchanged, continuing to register test implementations for `CommonDataProvider` and `FSAnalytics` for dependency injection.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on Attachment Uploads and Form Field State:** The most prominent pattern is a series of interconnected changes across multiple files aimed at improving the handling and display of attachment upload states within form fields. This includes how attachment data is passed, updated, and logged.
*   **Rapid Iteration and Debugging:** The short timestamps between changes, particularly the presence of incomplete code snippets and rapid corrections, suggest active, real-time debugging and development, often using `FSLogger.logWithTag` to inspect data at various points.
*   **Bloc Pattern and State Management:** The `JourneyFormDetailBloc` is central to state management for journey forms, emitting UI events and updating state. UI widgets (`JourneyFormDetailActivityFormContent`, `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField`) interact with this bloc to get and update form field data.
*   **Callback-based Data Access:** The introduction of the `getCurrentModel` callback in `FSFormItemItilAttachmentField` and its implementation in `JourneyFormDetailActivityFormContent` highlight a pattern of providing explicit callbacks to ensure components access the freshest state, rather than relying on potentially outdated direct references.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The use of `fsDIComponent` for dependency injection (e.g., `UploadFileToItilUseCase`) is consistent across the codebase, including test modules.
