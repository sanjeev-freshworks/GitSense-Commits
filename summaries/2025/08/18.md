# Activity Summary for 8/18/2025

## 5:17:19 PM
The log shows three consecutive updates to the `/Users/skumar14/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json` file between 4:31:07 PM and 4:33:35 PM on August 18, 2025.  The changes primarily involve adding a `ruby.`  key to the JSON object.  The first two revisions include a truncated `ruby.` key (missing a value). The final revision at 4:33:35 PM removes the incomplete `ruby.` key, resulting in a clean JSON object. The rest of the settings remain consistent across all three revisions, indicating configuration adjustments for various extensions and IDE features such as CodeGPT, GitHub Copilot, GitLens, and Python interpreter settings.  The user seems to be using Ollama as their CodeGPT API key and has several Copilot features enabled, particularly those related to TypeScript.
