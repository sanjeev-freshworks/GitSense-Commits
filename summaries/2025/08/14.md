# Activity Summary for 8/14/2025

## 11:24:49 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `.arb` files (presumably for internationalization) across different parts of a Freshservice mobile application (Flutter).  The updates span from 11:17 AM to 11:24 AM on August 14, 2025.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/journey_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` file was updated at 11:17:45 AM with a significant number of key-value pairs related to journey activities, including status updates ("Pending items", "Past items", "Overdue"), date formatting ("Created on", "Due by", "Completed on"), and user interface elements ("Mark as completed", "Read more").  This suggests localization for a task or journey management feature.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/support_portal_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` file received two updates. The first at 11:18:06 AM added "Complete your action items", and the second at 11:22:02 AM was an empty commit, potentially indicating a revision or rollback.  This points to ongoing work on action item management within the support portal.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` file was updated at 11:22:22 AM with extensive changes encompassing various support portal features.  The additions include keys for ticket management ("Status", "Ticket Assigned To", "Date Created"), service catalog interactions ("Request Service", "Service_Catalog"), user profile ("Profile Details"), and numerous other elements related to requests, assets, announcements, and user settings.  This shows significant localization work for the support portal's core functionalities.

Finally, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/common_ui/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` file was updated at 11:24:21 AM with common UI elements, error messages ("No network connection", "Access Denied"), time-ago formatting, file upload related messages ("file_type_not_whitelisted", "file_size_exceeded"), and translation-related keys.  This update centralizes general purpose UI and error handling text.

A recurring theme is the addition of localized strings for various features of the Freshservice mobile application. The use of placeholders (`{dateTime}`, `{count}`) indicates dynamic string generation based on context.  The updates seem to be part of a larger localization effort across different modules of the application.
