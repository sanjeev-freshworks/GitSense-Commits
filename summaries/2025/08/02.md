# Activity Summary for 8/2/2025

## 2:07:13 AM
The log shows updates to two files within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/route/solution_routes.dart` was updated at 12:04:05 AM on August 2nd, 2025.  This file defines routes for a solution feature, including paths for categories, folders, and search functionality.  The code defines constants for paths and functions to generate locations based on these paths.  It uses the `go_router` package.

The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/categories/view/channel_test_screen.dart` was updated twice, at 12:24:46 AM and 12:24:55 AM on August 2nd, 2025. This file contains a Flutter `ChannelTestScreen` that interacts with a native method channel ('com.example.channel'). The screen displays text received from the native side via the method channel.  The key change between the two updates was a minor refactoring within the `initState` method.  The initial version used `_setState()` while the second version uses `setState(() {})`.  Both versions extensively use `FSLogger` for logging throughout the lifecycle of the widget.  The logging consistently uses the tag "siderfighter-flutter".
