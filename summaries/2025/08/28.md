# Activity Summary for 8/28/2025

## 2:00:37 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/form/businessrule/condition/validator/user/br_current_user_condition_validator.dart` between 1:21:08 PM and 1:23:54 PM on August 28, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: validating business rule conditions against current user details.  The changes center around how the code handles cases where a condition's field name isn't directly found in `userFields`.

Initially, the code returned `null` if a field was not found in `userFields`. Subsequent revisions introduced checks against `bootstrapMe.customFields` to handle custom fields.  The logic evolved through several iterations:

* **1:21:32 PM:** Added a check for `bootstrapMe.customFields[condition.name] == null` along with `userField == null`.
* **1:21:50 PM & 1:21:55 PM:** Changed the check to use `bootstrapMe.customFields.contains(condition.name)`.
* **1:22:01 PM:** Removed the `return null` statement within the `if` condition, suggesting a different handling approach might be implemented later.
* **1:22:38 PM - 1:23:26 PM:** Attempted to modify `condition.name` by splitting it using `"cf_"` as a delimiter, presumably to extract a custom field name.  This approach had syntax errors initially (1:22:38 PM) then corrected (1:23:26 PM).
* **1:23:36 PM - 1:23:54 PM:**  The final revision successfully extracts the custom field name using `.split("cf_").last` and uses this modified name to lookup the field in `userFields`.


The constant values `_cnWorkspaceIds`, `_cnGroupIds`, `_cnDepartmentIds`, and `_cnReportingManagerId` are consistently used to handle specific field names within the `_validateUnknownField` function, suggesting these represent special cases requiring different validation logic.  The overall pattern shows a progressive refinement in handling custom user fields, ultimately leading to a more robust validation process by correctly mapping condition names to their respective custom fields in `userFields`.


## 3:00:33 PM
The log shows two nearly identical code changes made to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md` within a short time frame (8/28/2025, 2:56:36 PM and 8/28/2025, 2:56:54 PM).  Both entries are prompts for code generation related to the `support_portal` module.  The main difference lies in the API information source. The first uses  `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/approval/approval.md` and `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/approval/list/requester_success.json`, while the second uses `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/support_portal/solution/support_solution.md` and  `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/approval/list/requester_success.json`.  Despite this difference, both prompts specify the same output file names (`approval_remote_constants.dart`, `approval_remote_data_source.dart`, `approvals_repository.dart`, `approvals_repository_impl.dart`) and directory structure for mapper files.  The prompts consistently define query parameters (`page`, `per_page`, `approval_filter`), an enum (`priority`), and data formatting requirements (`responded_at`).  The seemingly erroneous use of the same response file (`../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/approval/list/requester_success.json`) in both entries suggests a potential error in the second prompt's specification.


## 4:32:29 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory.  The majority of changes center around the `solution_remote_data_source.dart` file between 3:52 PM and 3:55 PM on August 28, 2025. These modifications appear to be minor and iterative, with no substantial functional changes to the code itself across these multiple commits.  The code defines a `SolutionRemoteDataSource` class responsible for fetching data related to solutions, categories, folders, and articles from a remote API.  The methods consistently use a `get` function (presumably from a HTTP client) to make API calls, parse JSON responses, and map them to data models.  Error handling is implemented using a `CommonDataExceptionMapper`.

Later changes, between 3:56 PM and 4:31 PM on August 28, 2025,  focus on different files within the `features/solution` directory:

* **`solution_routes_builder.dart` (3:56 PM):** This file defines GoRouter routes for various solution-related screens (category list, folder list, folder detail, and search).  The routes are annotated with `@TypedGoRoute`, suggesting the use of a code generation tool. No further modifications are made to this file.


* **`solution_ui_module.dart` (3:56 PM):** This file registers dependencies for the UI layer using dependency injection (`fsDIComponent`).  It registers mappers and BLoCs (likely for categories, folder details, folder lists, and search functionality). No further modifications are made to this file.


* **`solution_domain_module.dart` (3:56 PM):** This file registers use cases for the domain layer using dependency injection (`fsDIComponent`). Use cases are registered for fetching solution categories, folders, subfolders, articles, and folder info. A minor commit was made at 3:56:44 PM, possibly cleaning up some redundant code.


* **`search_articles_navigation_state.freezed.dart` (4:00 PM - 4:01 PM):**  This file, generated by the `freezed` package, defines navigation states for search article results.  It handles navigation to article detail pages and external URLs. Multiple commits during this period might represent code generation runs or minor adjustments to the generated code.


* **`folder_detail_content.dart` (4:02 PM):** This component renders the content of a folder detail screen using `PagedListView` from the `infinite_scroll_pagination` package. It handles different UI models (`FolderItemUIModel`, `FolderItemFolderUIModel`, `FolderItemArticleUIModel`, `FolderItemExternalArticleUIModel`) and updates an event handler.  A minor change at 4:02:07 PM changed `onTap` for `ArticleItemWidget` from `null` to `() {}`, likely disabling article clicks. Another change at 4:02:22 PM appears to be a clean-up and no functional change.


* **`folder_detail_screen.dart` (4:04 PM - 4:05 PM and 4:09 PM):**  This screen uses Flutter Bloc to manage the state of the folder detail view. It listens for navigation events from the bloc and handles them accordingly (opening folder details, external URLs, and bottom sheets). There were several minor commits between 4:04 PM and 4:05 PM and a major commit at 4:09 PM, possibly for refactoring.


* **`.github/prompts/data/sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md` (4:17 PM - 4:31 PM):** This file contains prompts for a code generation tool (`data_layer_codegen`).  The prompts evolve over time, refining the specifications for generating data layer code (models, data sources, mappers, and repositories) for the "solution" module. These changes specify which fields to include in the models, how to handle enums, data types, where to place generated files, and whether to reuse existing models.  The module name changes from `support_portal` to `solution` in later commits.  The final prompt requests the generation of code for retrieving article details and specifies that single files should be used for API models, data models, and mappers to avoid creating numerous individual files for child types.  The use of the `common_business` module for `Attachment` and `CloudAttachment` models is also specified.



In summary, the log shows a combination of iterative adjustments in `solution_remote_data_source.dart`, the addition and minor refinements of UI routes and dependencies, and the evolution of a code generation prompt for the data layer, culminating in a detailed specification for generating a complete `Get Article Detail` functionality within the `solution` module. The changes are primarily related to the implementation and refinement of the Solution feature in the application.


## 5:32:20 PM
The log shows a series of code changes related to a "Solution" feature within a mobile Flutter application.  The primary focus appears to be on the implementation of "Get Article Detail" functionality.

Between 4:33 PM and 4:37 PM on August 28th, 2025, `solution_remote_constants.dart` underwent several minor revisions.  These changes seem inconsequential, possibly involving minor formatting adjustments or refactoring with no functional impact on the defined API endpoints and parameters. The file defines constants for various solution-related API endpoints, including categories, folders, articles, and search functionality.  It also specifies parameters like `exclude`, `page`, `per_page`, and `folder_id`, along with query parameters for search terms, user email, and language.

From 4:34 PM to 4:38 PM, the `sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md` file was updated multiple times.  These changes center around refining the input parameters for a code generation prompt.  The core objective remains consistent: generating data layer code (models, data sources, repositories) for the "Get Article Detail" API call within the "solution" module.  The iterations focus on clarifying specifications for handling enums (specifically the `status` field representing article publishing states),  handling optional fields, the date/time format of certain fields,  and the location of generated model files (reusing existing models or creating new ones).  The final version specifies that  `Attachment` and `CloudAttachment` models should reuse existing models from the `common_business` module, while other models should be created within the solution module.

At 4:37 PM, an `article_status.dart` file was created defining an `ArticleStatus` enum. The enum values and default value changed between 4:37 PM and 4:38 PM, reflecting the changes in `sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md`.

At 4:41 PM, an `article_detail_api_model.dart` file was created, likely as output from the code generation process described in `sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md`. This file contains API models for article details, including nested models for authors, attachments, and cloud attachments.

Subsequently, between 4:42 PM and 4:48 PM, the `article_detail.dart` file saw numerous identical commits.  This suggests that  version control might have automatically created these redundant entries for a single commit. This file defines a data model (`ArticleDetail`) using the `freezed` package, representing article details. It uses the previously defined `ArticleStatus` enum and reuses `Attachment` and `CloudAttachment` from the `common_business` module.

Finally, at 5:26 PM and 5:31 PM, two files, `tech_design.md`, were committed. These files contain a high level technical design document for the Agent Article Detail feature which includes a domain diagram showing the interaction between interactors, repositories, and models. It also contains the bloc diagram which shows how the bloc interacts with views, events and states.  The changes seem to indicate a shift in naming conventions (from "Article" to "Solution"), likely reflecting a broader restructuring or renaming effort within the project.
