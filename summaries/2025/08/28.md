# Activity Summary for 8/28/2025

## 2:00:37 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/form/businessrule/condition/validator/user/br_current_user_condition_validator.dart` between 1:21:08 PM and 1:23:54 PM on August 28, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: validating business rule conditions against current user details.  The changes center around how the code handles cases where a condition's field name isn't directly found in `userFields`.

Initially, the code returned `null` if a field was not found in `userFields`. Subsequent revisions introduced checks against `bootstrapMe.customFields` to handle custom fields.  The logic evolved through several iterations:

* **1:21:32 PM:** Added a check for `bootstrapMe.customFields[condition.name] == null` along with `userField == null`.
* **1:21:50 PM & 1:21:55 PM:** Changed the check to use `bootstrapMe.customFields.contains(condition.name)`.
* **1:22:01 PM:** Removed the `return null` statement within the `if` condition, suggesting a different handling approach might be implemented later.
* **1:22:38 PM - 1:23:26 PM:** Attempted to modify `condition.name` by splitting it using `"cf_"` as a delimiter, presumably to extract a custom field name.  This approach had syntax errors initially (1:22:38 PM) then corrected (1:23:26 PM).
* **1:23:36 PM - 1:23:54 PM:**  The final revision successfully extracts the custom field name using `.split("cf_").last` and uses this modified name to lookup the field in `userFields`.


The constant values `_cnWorkspaceIds`, `_cnGroupIds`, `_cnDepartmentIds`, and `_cnReportingManagerId` are consistently used to handle specific field names within the `_validateUnknownField` function, suggesting these represent special cases requiring different validation logic.  The overall pattern shows a progressive refinement in handling custom user fields, ultimately leading to a more robust validation process by correctly mapping condition names to their respective custom fields in `userFields`.


## 3:00:33 PM
The log shows two nearly identical code changes made to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/prompts/data/sample_data_layer_codegen.prompt.md` within a short time frame (8/28/2025, 2:56:36 PM and 8/28/2025, 2:56:54 PM).  Both entries are prompts for code generation related to the `support_portal` module.  The main difference lies in the API information source. The first uses  `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/approval/approval.md` and `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/approval/list/requester_success.json`, while the second uses `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/documentation/responses/support_portal/solution/support_solution.md` and  `../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/approval/list/requester_success.json`.  Despite this difference, both prompts specify the same output file names (`approval_remote_constants.dart`, `approval_remote_data_source.dart`, `approvals_repository.dart`, `approvals_repository_impl.dart`) and directory structure for mapper files.  The prompts consistently define query parameters (`page`, `per_page`, `approval_filter`), an enum (`priority`), and data formatting requirements (`responded_at`).  The seemingly erroneous use of the same response file (`../../../freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/approval/list/requester_success.json`) in both entries suggests a potential error in the second prompt's specification.
