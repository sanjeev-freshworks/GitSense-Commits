# Activity Summary for 8/29/2025

## 9:52:22 AM
The code changes primarily focus on the `solution` feature of a Flutter mobile application.  Several files related to article and folder details were updated between 9:26 AM and 9:40 AM on August 29, 2025.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/model/article_detail_screen_args.dart`: This file defines a simple data class `ArticleDetailScreenArgs` to pass arguments (`articleId` and `parentFolderName`) to the article detail screen.  This change happened at 9:26:36 AM.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/route/solution_routes_builder.dart`: This file defines routes for various screens within the solution feature using `go_router`.  Routes were defined for category list, folder list, folder detail, article detail, and two search screens.  Each route is annotated with `@TypedGoRoute` and handles screen arguments appropriately. This was updated at 9:27:10 AM.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/presentation/model/article_detail_navigation_state.dart`:  This file defines a sealed class `ArticleDetailNavigationState` using Freezed. This class manages different navigation states within the article detail screen, including opening bottom sheets for article info, supported languages, cloud attachments, and handling file downloads and previews. The update time was 9:28:58 AM.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/view/helper/article_detail_helper.dart`: This file contains helper functions for the article detail screen.  The `shouldListenBlocState` function determines when to rebuild based on changes in `userMessage` and `navigationState`. The `listenBlocState` function handles UI updates based on the `ArticleDetailNavigationState`.  Multiple updates to this file occurred between 9:32:18 AM and 9:39:41 AM, primarily refining the handling of `parentFolderName` in the `_showArticleDetailInfo` function and making the code more robust.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/presentation/bloc/article_detail_bloc.dart`: This file defines a BLoC (`ArticleDetailBloc`) managing the state and events for the article detail screen. The bloc handles loading article details, language selection, showing article info, copying text, and managing attachments (cloud and file system attachments). It interacts with various use cases and analytics. This file saw multiple updates between 9:33:00 AM and 9:38:43 AM.  A key change was fixing the usage of `_args.parentFolderName` in the `_onArticleInfoIconClicked` function for consistent argument passing.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/folder_detail_screen.dart`: This file implements the folder detail screen using BlocProvider and BlocConsumer.  It handles navigation to other screens (folder detail, article detail, external URLs) and shows a bottom sheet for folder information. Updates between 9:40:09 AM and 9:40:49 AM focused on correcting the passing of the `parentFolderName` argument to the `FolderInfoWidget` component.

In summary, the changes revolve around improving the handling of navigation and data flow between different screens in the solution feature, particularly focusing on consistent passing of `parentFolderName` arguments and robust error handling in the `ArticleDetailBloc`.  The updates indicate iterative development and bug fixing.

The log shows a single code change on August 29th, 2025 at 11:49:56 AM.  This modification updated the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/solution/get_folder_parent_path/success.json` file. The change involved updating the JSON response for a successful `get_folder_parent_path` API call. The updated JSON now includes two folders: "IT policies" (id: 27000169987, parent_id: null) and "Sub Folder 1" (id: 27000184073, parent_id: 27000169987), showing a parent-child relationship between the folders.
