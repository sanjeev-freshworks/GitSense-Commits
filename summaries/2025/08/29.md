# Activity Summary for 8/29/2025

## 9:52:22 AM
The code changes primarily focus on the `solution` feature of a Flutter mobile application.  Several files related to article and folder details were updated between 9:26 AM and 9:40 AM on August 29, 2025.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/model/article_detail_screen_args.dart`: This file defines a simple data class `ArticleDetailScreenArgs` to pass arguments (`articleId` and `parentFolderName`) to the article detail screen.  This change happened at 9:26:36 AM.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/route/solution_routes_builder.dart`: This file defines routes for various screens within the solution feature using `go_router`.  Routes were defined for category list, folder list, folder detail, article detail, and two search screens.  Each route is annotated with `@TypedGoRoute` and handles screen arguments appropriately. This was updated at 9:27:10 AM.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/presentation/model/article_detail_navigation_state.dart`:  This file defines a sealed class `ArticleDetailNavigationState` using Freezed. This class manages different navigation states within the article detail screen, including opening bottom sheets for article info, supported languages, cloud attachments, and handling file downloads and previews. The update time was 9:28:58 AM.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/view/helper/article_detail_helper.dart`: This file contains helper functions for the article detail screen.  The `shouldListenBlocState` function determines when to rebuild based on changes in `userMessage` and `navigationState`. The `listenBlocState` function handles UI updates based on the `ArticleDetailNavigationState`.  Multiple updates to this file occurred between 9:32:18 AM and 9:39:41 AM, primarily refining the handling of `parentFolderName` in the `_showArticleDetailInfo` function and making the code more robust.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/article_detail/presentation/bloc/article_detail_bloc.dart`: This file defines a BLoC (`ArticleDetailBloc`) managing the state and events for the article detail screen. The bloc handles loading article details, language selection, showing article info, copying text, and managing attachments (cloud and file system attachments). It interacts with various use cases and analytics. This file saw multiple updates between 9:33:00 AM and 9:38:43 AM.  A key change was fixing the usage of `_args.parentFolderName` in the `_onArticleInfoIconClicked` function for consistent argument passing.


`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/folder_detail_screen.dart`: This file implements the folder detail screen using BlocProvider and BlocConsumer.  It handles navigation to other screens (folder detail, article detail, external URLs) and shows a bottom sheet for folder information. Updates between 9:40:09 AM and 9:40:49 AM focused on correcting the passing of the `parentFolderName` argument to the `FolderInfoWidget` component.

In summary, the changes revolve around improving the handling of navigation and data flow between different screens in the solution feature, particularly focusing on consistent passing of `parentFolderName` arguments and robust error handling in the `ArticleDetailBloc`.  The updates indicate iterative development and bug fixing.


## 11:52:15 AM
The log shows a single code change on August 29th, 2025 at 11:49:56 AM.  This modification updated the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/response/solution/get_folder_parent_path/success.json` file. The change involved updating the JSON response for a successful `get_folder_parent_path` API call. The updated JSON now includes two folders: "IT policies" (id: 27000169987, parent_id: null) and "Sub Folder 1" (id: 27000184073, parent_id: 27000169987), showing a parent-child relationship between the folders.


## 4:53:40 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to several Dart files within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory between 2:53 PM and 4:32 PM on August 29, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the `folder_detail` feature.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/helper/usecase/get_folder_info_details_use_case.dart`**: This file underwent several minor revisions between 2:53 PM and 4:01 PM. These revisions involved correcting the `getOrThrow()` method call and adding the `commonUILoc` parameter to the `FolderInfoUiModelMapperInput` class within the `protectedExecute` method.  The most significant change was the addition of the `parentId` parameter to the `GetFolderInfoDetailsUseCaseParam` class at 4:01 PM, allowing for the retrieval of parent folder information.  The final version includes all necessary parameters for a comprehensive folder info retrieval.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/model/folder_info_ui_model.dart`**: This file was modified between 2:58 PM and 4:21 PM. The initial changes involved replacing `SolutionParent` with `SolutionFolderParentPath` as a data type for the `parentFolder` field, reflecting changes in data structure. Subsequently,  `parentFolder` was removed entirely at 4:12 PM, and then later the `categoryName` and `categoryId` fields were added, finalizing the model structure.


**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/mapper/folder_info_ui_model_mapper.dart`**: This mapper underwent significant changes between 3:02 PM and 4:17 PM. The key changes included:
* Initially, `parentFolder` was set to `null`.
* Then, it was correctly set to `input.folderParentPath`, but still lacked the `parentFolderId` and `parentFolderName` fields.
* The final version included the `parentFolderId` and `parentFolderName` fields in the output `FolderInfoUiModel`, populated correctly from `folderParentPath`, ensuring a more complete mapping.  The changes involved multiple attempts to accurately set the `parentFolderId` and `parentFolderName`.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/bloc/folder_detail_bloc.dart`**:  This file was modified extensively between 3:52 PM and 4:32 PM.  The most significant change was the replacement of `_getSolutionFolderInfoUseCase` and `_getSolutionFolderParentUseCase` with `_getFolderInfoDetailsUseCase` at 3:57 PM for improved data fetching efficiency.  This simplified the code and centralized the folder information retrieval.  Further minor changes dealt with refining conditional logic and error handling, primarily surrounding the `_onFolderInfoClicked` event.  The final version uses the consolidated `GetFolderInfoDetailsUseCase`.

**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/di/solution_ui_module.dart`**: This file reflects the changes in the `FolderDetailBloc` by registering `GetFolderInfoDetailsUseCase` to replace the previous use cases at 3:53 PM.  This ensured the dependency injection correctly reflected the code changes and consistent use of the new use case. The repeated `registerFactoryParam` calls for `FolderDetailBloc` were likely accidental and removed in the last changes.


**`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/folder_info_widget.dart` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/folder_detail_screen.dart`**: These files were updated to reflect the changes in the `FolderInfoUiModel` at 4:24 PM and 4:25 PM respectively. This includes  the addition of `parentFolderName` and `parentFolderId` to the UI and updated handling of the navigation to the parent folder in the Folder Info Bottom Sheet.  Further adjustments in `FolderDetailScreen` improved the handling of navigation states and null checks.

In summary, the code changes demonstrate a refactoring effort to improve the `folder_detail` feature by streamlining folder information retrieval, updating data models, and enhancing the UI to display parent folder information.  The use of a single `GetFolderInfoDetailsUseCase` instead of separate use cases improved efficiency and maintainability.  The timestamps show a focused development period where these changes were iteratively implemented and refined.


## 5:52:23 PM
The code changes span several files within the `features/solution` directory of a Flutter project, focusing on the presentation and mapping of solution folder details.  The changes primarily occurred between 4:53 PM and 4:58 PM on August 29, 2025.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/domain/usecase/get_solution_folder_parent_use_case.dart` (4:53 PM): This file defines a use case to retrieve the parent path of a solution folder.  It uses a `SolutionRepository` to fetch the parent path and returns a `SolutionFolderParentPath` object.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/helper/usecase/get_folder_info_details_use_case.dart` (4:55 PM): This file introduces a use case to retrieve detailed information for a folder, combining data from multiple sources (`GetSolutionFolderInfoUseCase`, `GetSolutionFolderParentUseCase`, `GetBootstrapAccountUseCase`) and mapping it to a `FolderInfoUiModel`.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/presentation/mapper/folder_info_ui_model_mapper.dart` (4:55 PM and 4:56 PM): This mapper translates data from backend models (`FolderInfo`, `SolutionFolderParentPath`, `BootstrapAccount`) into a `FolderInfoUiModel` for presentation.  Significant logic exists within this mapper to handle visibility determination based on different user roles and workspace access, using `FolderVisibility` enum, and to format the managed-by information.  A minor correction was made to the `parentFolderName` and `parentFolderId` retrieval, potentially fixing a null pointer issue.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/model/folder_info_ui_model.dart` (4:56 PM): This file defines the `FolderInfoUiModel` data class, which is used for presenting folder information in the UI. It uses the `freezed` package for immutable data classes.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/components/folder_info_widget.dart` (4:57 PM): This widget displays the folder information (`FolderInfoUiModel`)  in a user-friendly format. It includes a header with the folder name and description, a section displaying the folder location (allowing navigation), and details such as managed-by, visibility, article count, and subfolder count. Two nearly identical commits to this file suggest a minor code adjustment or formatting fix.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/folder_detail/view/folder_detail_screen.dart` (4:57 PM and 4:58 PM): This screen uses a `Bloc` pattern to manage the folder detail view's state and navigation.  It handles various navigation events, including opening article details, external URLs, subfolders, and a bottom sheet for detailed folder information.  A correction was made to handle the navigation to the parent folder, ensuring that the category name is used if there is no `parentFolderName`.

The overall pattern shows a well-structured application using use cases, mappers, and a Bloc architecture for managing UI state and navigation related to solution folders.  The use of multiple libraries such as `freezed`, `fs_logger`, and different localization libraries suggests a larger, well-maintained project.  The timestamps indicate a short period of focused development and refinement.
