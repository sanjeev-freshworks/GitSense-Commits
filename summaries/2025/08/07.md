# Activity Summary for 8/7/2025

## 12:54:18 PM
The log shows updates to several files across a Flutter project, primarily focused on the support portal feature and its associated tests.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/pubspec.yaml` file was updated twice within a short time frame (8/7/2025, 10:03:01 AM and 8/7/2025, 10:03:53 AM).  The only change between these two versions was the removal of a duplicate `fs_logger: '1.0.0'` entry from the `dependencies` section. This file lists various dependencies, both local packages (e.g., `core`, `core_ui`, `common_base`) and third-party packages (e.g., `flutter_bloc`, `go_router`, `provider`).  The versions suggest a relatively standard Flutter project setup.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/ios/Podfile.lock` file was modified multiple times between 11:39:58 AM and 11:51:39 AM on 8/7/2025. These changes appear to be related to updating the CocoaPods dependencies, specifically adjusting the path for `webview_flutter_wkwebview` from `darwin` to `ios`. The checksums changed with each update, indicating that there were underlying changes to the installed pods.  The changes appear minor in the context of the file content but reflect multiple pod update attempts.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/melos.yaml` file was updated at 11:40:51 AM on 8/7/2025.  This file is a configuration file for managing a monorepo project, specifying different packages and scripts related to building and testing the project, including Flutter analysis, formatting, building and testing processes. It uses multiple Flutter and Dart tools and has scripts for managing and running tests.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/solution/constants/solution_api_path.dart` file shows no content changes between two successive timestamps (12:11:57 PM and 12:12:02 PM on 8/7/2025).

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/solution/constants/solution_stubs.dart` file underwent several revisions between 12:12:14 PM and 12:12:42 PM on 8/7/2025.  These changes involved adding several new stub file paths (`searchArticlesPage1`, `searchArticlesPage2`, `searchArticlesEmpty`), seemingly to support additional test scenarios related to search functionality within the solution.  The initial revision showed a merge conflict marker, indicating that a merge operation occurred.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/features/support/solution/folder_subfolder_list/folder_subfolder_list_test.dart` file shows three revisions between 12:24:54 PM and 12:50:07 PM on 8/7/2025. The changes involved adjustments to import statements, specifically replacing a `theFsnativeappIsInitialized` function with `theFsnativeappIsInitializedInMode` to incorporate a mode parameter. Further refactoring involved improving the readability of the test code and adding more descriptive identifiers, while functionality remains consistent.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/features/support/solution/folder_subfolder_list/folder_subfolder_list.feature` file was updated at 12:38:13 PM on 8/7/2025. This file appears to be a BDD feature file outlining various test scenarios for the solution folders and articles. The scenarios cover different aspects of the UI, including navigation, display of counts, error handling and network disconnections.
