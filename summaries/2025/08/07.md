# Activity Summary for 8/7/2025

## 12:54:18 PM
The log shows updates to several files across a Flutter project, primarily focused on the support portal feature and its associated tests.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/pubspec.yaml` file was updated twice within a short time frame (8/7/2025, 10:03:01 AM and 8/7/2025, 10:03:53 AM).  The only change between these two versions was the removal of a duplicate `fs_logger: '1.0.0'` entry from the `dependencies` section. This file lists various dependencies, both local packages (e.g., `core`, `core_ui`, `common_base`) and third-party packages (e.g., `flutter_bloc`, `go_router`, `provider`).  The versions suggest a relatively standard Flutter project setup.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fs_ui_catalog_app/ios/Podfile.lock` file was modified multiple times between 11:39:58 AM and 11:51:39 AM on 8/7/2025. These changes appear to be related to updating the CocoaPods dependencies, specifically adjusting the path for `webview_flutter_wkwebview` from `darwin` to `ios`. The checksums changed with each update, indicating that there were underlying changes to the installed pods.  The changes appear minor in the context of the file content but reflect multiple pod update attempts.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/melos.yaml` file was updated at 11:40:51 AM on 8/7/2025.  This file is a configuration file for managing a monorepo project, specifying different packages and scripts related to building and testing the project, including Flutter analysis, formatting, building and testing processes. It uses multiple Flutter and Dart tools and has scripts for managing and running tests.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/solution/constants/solution_api_path.dart` file shows no content changes between two successive timestamps (12:11:57 PM and 12:12:02 PM on 8/7/2025).

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/solution/constants/solution_stubs.dart` file underwent several revisions between 12:12:14 PM and 12:12:42 PM on 8/7/2025.  These changes involved adding several new stub file paths (`searchArticlesPage1`, `searchArticlesPage2`, `searchArticlesEmpty`), seemingly to support additional test scenarios related to search functionality within the solution.  The initial revision showed a merge conflict marker, indicating that a merge operation occurred.


The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/features/support/solution/folder_subfolder_list/folder_subfolder_list_test.dart` file shows three revisions between 12:24:54 PM and 12:50:07 PM on 8/7/2025. The changes involved adjustments to import statements, specifically replacing a `theFsnativeappIsInitialized` function with `theFsnativeappIsInitializedInMode` to incorporate a mode parameter. Further refactoring involved improving the readability of the test code and adding more descriptive identifiers, while functionality remains consistent.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/features/support/solution/folder_subfolder_list/folder_subfolder_list.feature` file was updated at 12:38:13 PM on 8/7/2025. This file appears to be a BDD feature file outlining various test scenarios for the solution folders and articles. The scenarios cover different aspects of the UI, including navigation, display of counts, error handling and network disconnections.


## 1:54:26 PM
The log shows iterative development of Flutter test code and a related DI module.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/solution/i_am_on_the_solution_home_page.dart` file underwent several revisions between 1:23 PM and 1:36 PM on August 7, 2025.  Initial versions focused on navigating to a solution home page ("/support/solutions/v2") and handling potential delays during app initialization using `pumpAndSettle`.  Subsequent changes added debugging code to print rendered text widgets, check for specific elements ("Facilities", CircularProgressIndicator), and identify error messages.  Finally, the settling time in `pumpAndSettle` was adjusted multiple times, ultimately settling on `pumpAndSettle()` without a specified duration.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/solution_v2/di/solution_v2_ui_module.dart` file was modified between 1:29 PM and 1:31 PM on August 7, 2025. This file, a dependency injection module, registers various mappers and BLoCs (Business Logic Components) related to the solution v2 UI.  A key change involved simplifying the `SolutionHomePageBloc` registration by removing a dependency on `GetPopularArticlesAndCategoriesUseCase`.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/agent/delegate_approval/i_do_the_setup_for_loading_approval_list.dart` file was updated at 1:33:07 PM on August 7, 2025.  This file sets up mock HTTP responses for approval list and delegation endpoints.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/features/support/solution/folder_subfolder_list/folder_subfolder_list_test.dart` file shows a comprehensive set of widget tests for the solution folder/subfolder list feature, created at 1:33:48 PM on August 7, 2025. These tests cover various scenarios including navigation, count verification, error handling, and UI element checks.

Finally, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/features/support/solution/folder_subfolder_list/folder_subfolder_list.feature` file was updated at 1:39:23 PM and 1:50:48 PM on August 7, 2025. This file contains BDD (Behavior Driven Development) scenarios outlining the expected behavior of the solution folder/subfolder list feature.  The second update at 1:50:48 PM mostly added "And I do the setup for loading solution folder list" and "And I do the setup for loading solution sub folder list" to the Background section.  This suggests a refactoring to better organize the setup steps for the tests.
