# Activity Summary for 8/8/2025

## 10:33:03 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of a single Dart file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/features/support/solution/folder_subfolder_list/folder_subfolder_list_test.dart`, containing unit tests for a Flutter application.  The file's content remains largely consistent across all revisions, focusing on testing various aspects of displaying solution folders and articles within a "Freshservice" app, specifically for requesters.


The changes primarily involve minor formatting adjustments within the `testWidgets` functions.  Specifically,  extra parentheses and commas are added around function arguments in several test cases between the timestamps 8/8/2025, 9:28:08 AM and 8/8/2025, 9:31:34 AM.  These are likely stylistic changes or automatic formatting adjustments made by an IDE or code formatter.

A more significant change occurs between 8/8/2025, 9:30:42 AM and 8/8/2025, 9:31:34 AM.  The `bddSetUp` function is modified; `theFsnativeappIsInitializedInMode(tester, "agent")` is replaced with `theFsnativeappIsInitialized(tester)`. This suggests a simplification or refactoring of the initialization process within the test setup.  The overall functionality of the tests, however, appears unchanged across all revisions.  All test cases are tagged as `['FunctionalTest']`.


## 11:34:28 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/solution_v2/article_detail/view/content/article_detail_content.dart` file between 10:55 AM and 11:30 AM on August 8th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the UI rendering of article details, specifically how attachments and related articles are displayed.

Initially, the code used `SingleChildScrollView` for the article content.  Between 10:55 AM and 11:28 AM, several minor revisions occurred, mainly involving the `onArticleTap` parameter in the `ArticleItem` widget, changing it to `onTap` and then to `onArticleTap` again, and finally adding `onExternalArticleTap`.  Around 11:28 AM, a significant change was introduced: the UI structure was refactored to use `CustomScrollView` with `Sliver` widgets for better performance and layout control.  This involved creating several new helper functions: `_buildArticleBodySliver`, `_buildAttachmentsSliver`, `_buildRelatedArticlesHeaderSliver`, `_buildRelatedArticlesSliver`, `_buildSpacingSliver`, and `_buildDividerSliver`. The `ArticleItem` widget now consistently uses `onArticleTap` and `onExternalArticleTap` for handling internal and external article clicks respectively. There was also a short period where a `void _launchRelatedArticle` function was incomplete, followed by its completion and refining of the logic to handle external articles.


The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/domain/di/solution_support_portal_domain_module.dart` was modified once at 11:21:18 AM on August 8th, 2025. This change involved registering several use cases related to solution support portals, including those for fetching popular articles, categories, search results, article details, and related articles.  This suggests an update to the application's dependency injection configuration for the solution support portal domain.
