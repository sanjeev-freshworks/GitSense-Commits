# Activity Summary for 8/8/2025

## 10:33:03 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of a single Dart file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/features/support/solution/folder_subfolder_list/folder_subfolder_list_test.dart`, containing unit tests for a Flutter application.  The file's content remains largely consistent across all revisions, focusing on testing various aspects of displaying solution folders and articles within a "Freshservice" app, specifically for requesters.


The changes primarily involve minor formatting adjustments within the `testWidgets` functions.  Specifically,  extra parentheses and commas are added around function arguments in several test cases between the timestamps 8/8/2025, 9:28:08 AM and 8/8/2025, 9:31:34 AM.  These are likely stylistic changes or automatic formatting adjustments made by an IDE or code formatter.

A more significant change occurs between 8/8/2025, 9:30:42 AM and 8/8/2025, 9:31:34 AM.  The `bddSetUp` function is modified; `theFsnativeappIsInitializedInMode(tester, "agent")` is replaced with `theFsnativeappIsInitialized(tester)`. This suggests a simplification or refactoring of the initialization process within the test setup.  The overall functionality of the tests, however, appears unchanged across all revisions.  All test cases are tagged as `['FunctionalTest']`.


## 11:34:28 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/solution_v2/article_detail/view/content/article_detail_content.dart` file between 10:55 AM and 11:30 AM on August 8th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the UI rendering of article details, specifically how attachments and related articles are displayed.

Initially, the code used `SingleChildScrollView` for the article content.  Between 10:55 AM and 11:28 AM, several minor revisions occurred, mainly involving the `onArticleTap` parameter in the `ArticleItem` widget, changing it to `onTap` and then to `onArticleTap` again, and finally adding `onExternalArticleTap`.  Around 11:28 AM, a significant change was introduced: the UI structure was refactored to use `CustomScrollView` with `Sliver` widgets for better performance and layout control.  This involved creating several new helper functions: `_buildArticleBodySliver`, `_buildAttachmentsSliver`, `_buildRelatedArticlesHeaderSliver`, `_buildRelatedArticlesSliver`, `_buildSpacingSliver`, and `_buildDividerSliver`. The `ArticleItem` widget now consistently uses `onArticleTap` and `onExternalArticleTap` for handling internal and external article clicks respectively. There was also a short period where a `void _launchRelatedArticle` function was incomplete, followed by its completion and refining of the logic to handle external articles.


The file `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/domain/di/solution_support_portal_domain_module.dart` was modified once at 11:21:18 AM on August 8th, 2025. This change involved registering several use cases related to solution support portals, including those for fetching popular articles, categories, search results, article details, and related articles.  This suggests an update to the application's dependency injection configuration for the solution support portal domain.


## 2:35:44 PM
The log shows a series of code changes across multiple files within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice` project, primarily focused on features related to a support portal and its solution articles.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/domain/di/solution_support_portal_domain_module.dart` file was updated at 12:44:08 PM on August 8th, 2025.  This update registered various use cases and interactors related to retrieving solution articles, categories, and folders within a dependency injection framework (likely using a `fsDIComponent`).  The code heavily involves use cases for retrieving solution data, suggesting work on the backend interaction for the solution articles feature.

Two identical updates to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/bdd_steps/support/solution/folder_subfolder_list/i_should_be_navigated_to_folder_list_page.dart` occurred at 1:05:41 PM and 1:05:51 PM on August 8th, 2025. These updates involved a BDD step (`iShouldBeNavigatedToFolderListPage`) for verifying navigation to a folder list page in UI tests. The function logs visible text and checks for specific images. The near-simultaneous updates suggest a minor, inconsequential edit.

A mock JSON response file, `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/freshservice_mobile_api_mock/functional/requester/solutions/folder_list/folder_list.json`, was updated at 1:09:50 PM on August 8th, 2025.  This mock data represents folders, subfolders, and articles, used likely for testing purposes.  The structure indicates a hierarchical data model for solutions.

The `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/features/support/solution/folder_subfolder_list/folder_subfolder_list.feature` file underwent two updates at 1:12:10 PM and 1:12:37 PM on August 8th, 2025. This file contains BDD-style feature tests for the solution folder and subfolder list functionalities for requesters. The second update removed a commented-out test scenario.  The tests cover various aspects of folder and article display, including handling empty categories and folders, error states and display of lengthy folder and article names.

A `.md` file (`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/.github/instructions/functional_testing/sample_functioal_testing_codegen.prompt.md`)  was repeatedly updated between 1:48:50 PM and 1:51:37 PM on August 8th, 2025.  These updates refined the description of a user story (FS-279164) and a corresponding test case (TC-61745717 and later TC-61753136) related to the display of related articles at the bottom of a solution article page. The description became more detailed, encompassing positive scenarios, error handling, and edge cases.  The test case description was enhanced to include steps for execution and expected results.

Finally, the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/features/requester/solution/FS-279164.feature` and `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/test/features/requester/solution/FS-279164_test.dart` files were updated between 1:52:39 PM and 2:10:42 PM on August 8th, 2025.  These files, linked to user story FS-279164, contain the feature file and corresponding test code for verifying the display of related articles.  The test was initially implemented, then modified to use a specific route for the solution article page ("/support/solutions/v2/articles/1234?article-name=Sample+Article"), and a screenshot was added to the test. The route suggests a change in the application's routing structure to accommodate the "related articles" feature.  The series of commits reflect an iterative process of test development and refinement.


## 4:35:37 PM
The log shows a series of code changes related to testing the solution folder and article viewing feature in a Freshservice mobile app.  The main focus is on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule` directory.

The initial change at 4:26:33 PM involves updating a feature file (`folder_subfolder_list.feature`) which outlines various test scenarios for verifying different aspects of the UI, such as displaying folder lists, article counts, subfolder counts, handling empty categories or folders, and error handling for network disconnections.  These scenarios cover various edge cases, including handling lengthy folder and article names.

Almost immediately after (4:27:01 PM), the corresponding test file (`folder_subfolder_list_test.dart`) is updated. This file uses the BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) framework and contains `testWidgets` functions that directly correspond to the scenarios defined in the `.feature` file.  Each test uses various helper functions from other files (like `iTapText`, `iLetTheUiSettle`, `iSeeText`, etc.) to interact with and verify the UI.


Between 4:31:45 PM and 4:33:54 PM, the file `i_should_be_navigated_to_folder_list_page.dart` undergoes multiple revisions. The main change involves adding logging of visible text elements on the folder list page using `FSLogger`. This addition appears and disappears between revisions, suggesting that it might have been an experimental feature or a debugging attempt. The final version of the file at 4:33:54 PM removes the logging functionality.  The file itself appears to be a helper function for verifying navigation to the correct page after tapping on a category.

In summary, the code changes reflect a comprehensive testing effort focusing on the solution folder and subfolder list view in the mobile app.  The updates primarily involve adding and refining test scenarios, test implementation, and adding/removing temporary logging. The recurring element is the consistent use of a BDD testing framework and the repeated verification of UI elements and their states under various conditions.
