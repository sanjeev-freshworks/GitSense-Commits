# Activity Summary for 8/3/2025

## 12:16:02 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/categories/view/channel_test_screen.dart` file between 12:01 PM and 12:08 PM on August 3rd, 2025.  The core functionality remains unchanged: a Flutter screen (`ChannelTestScreen`) that uses a method channel (`com.example.channel`) to update its displayed text.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing logging within the `initState` method.

Initially, logging statements were less detailed.  Subsequent revisions progressively added more context to the log messages within the `setState` function, specifically including the previous and incoming text values to track the text updates more effectively.  The final version (12:08:56 PM) provides the most comprehensive logging information, incorporating the `call.arguments` directly into the log message for better debugging.  There were no structural code changes; only the logging messages inside the `setState` function were modified.
