# Activity Summary for 8/4/2025

## 12:35:39 PM
The log shows two entries for `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/apps/fsmodule/lib/main_dev.dart`, both on August 4th, 2025.  The first entry is at 12:35:16 PM and the second at 12:35:32 PM.  The code in both entries is identical.  The file `main_dev.dart` appears to be the main entry point for development and testing of the `fsmodule`, setting up dependency injection (`FSModuleDIModule.register`), initializing services (including time zones), and launching the app with a specific initial route (`/cmdb/items/new`).  The code uses several external packages including `common_business`, `common_test`, `core`, `flutter`, `timezone`, and `user_lib`.  The only apparent difference between the two log entries is the timestamp, suggesting a possible duplicated or near-instantaneous second commit.  No substantive code changes occurred between the two commits.
