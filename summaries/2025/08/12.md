# Activity Summary for 8/12/2025

## 5:23:07 AM
The log shows multiple code changes across several files related to a Freshservice support portal feature.  The main focus appears to be on the implementation and testing of a search articles functionality, along with the display and handling of article details.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/solution_v2/search_articles/view/search_articles_view_helper.dart` (8/11/2025, 6:53:14 PM): This file contains helper functions for the search articles view.  `shouldListenBloc` determines when to update the UI based on state changes.  `listenBlocState` handles UI updates such as showing snackbars for user messages and navigating to article detail or browser pages based on navigation states.  Navigation is implemented using `ArticleDetailV2ScreenRoute` for articles and `UrlLauncherHelper` for external URLs, with error handling for failed external article launches.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/test/ui/solution_v2/search_articles/presentation/bloc/search_solution_bloc_test.dart` (Multiple timestamps): This file contains extensive unit tests for the `SearchSolutionBloc`.  The tests cover various scenarios, including:

* **Initial state verification:** Checks if the bloc starts with the correct initial state.
* **QueryChanged event handling:** Tests how the bloc responds to different search queries (empty, single character, multiple characters, including debouncing and cancellation).
* **LoadSearchResults event handling:**  Tests successful and failed search scenarios, including pagination.  It verifies the correct update of the UI state based on successful and failed use cases.
* **CancelableOperation functionality:** Tests the cancellation of ongoing operations when the query is empty or when the paging state is reset, and also ensures that a new search cancels the previous one.

A noticeable pattern in these test files is the extensive use of `bloc_test`, `mockito`, and fixture data (`SearchArticlesResultFixture`, `ArticleItemUiModelFixture`) to create comprehensive tests.  The imports show a dependency on several libraries, including `bloc`, `mockito`, `flutter_test`, `common_ui`, and `core`.  Between the timestamps of 8/11/2025, 6:53:31 PM and 8/11/2025, 7:22:23 PM, the test file was repeatedly modified.  A significant change happened at 8/11/2025, 6:53:49 PM, where  `import '../../../../../testfixture/ui/solution_v2/article_item_ui_model_fixture.dart';` was added.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/libraries/fs_lib/solution_lib/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` (Multiple timestamps): This file contains the English localization strings for the solution library.  Between 8/11/2025, 7:13:51 PM and 8/11/2025, 7:17:21 PM, this file was repeatedly modified, primarily to add and refine the `externalArticleLaunchErrorMessage` string. The final version includes the message:  "This article can't be previewed on mobile. Try with the Freshservice web app."  This suggests improvements to user experience around handling external articles.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/solution_v2/search_articles/presentation/model/event/search_articles_event.dart` (Multiple timestamps): This file defines the events for the `SearchSolutionBloc`.  The changes here involved refining the `SearchArticlesEventExternalArticleLaunchFailure` event, initially missing a required parameter (`solutionLibLoc`), and later fully defining it to include `solutionLibLoc` and correct syntax.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/solution_v2/search_articles/presentation/bloc/search_solution_bloc.dart` (Multiple timestamps):  This file implements the `SearchSolutionBloc`.  The modifications centered around error handling for external article launches. The final update uses `UserMessage.string` to display a localized error message instead of a generic exception message.  A debounce mechanism (500ms) was implemented on the search query using `debounceTime` in Rxdart.  This improves performance by preventing excessive API calls during rapid typing.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/solution_v2/search_articles/view/search_articles_screen.dart` (Multiple timestamps): This file implements the UI for the search articles screen.  The main changes focused on correctly passing the `solutionLibLoc` to the `SearchArticlesEventExternalArticleLaunchFailure` event within the `_listenState` function, ensuring proper error message localization. The changes showcase a consistent approach towards error handling and UI updates, ensuring that error messages are localized and displayed appropriately to the user.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/solution_v2/article_detail/presentation/model/article_detail_event.dart` (Two timestamps): This file defines events related to article details, specifically handling attachments and related articles. The most significant change is the addition of `solutionLibLoc` to `ArticleDetailEventRelatedExternalArticleLaunchFailed` for localized error messaging.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/solution_v2/article_detail/presentation/bloc/article_detail_bloc.dart` (Multiple timestamps): This file implements the bloc for handling article detail actions. The major updates correct how the error message is displayed in  `_onRelatedExternalArticleLaunchFailed`.  The error message is now properly localized and displayed using the provided `solutionLibLoc`.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/lib/src/ui/solution_v2/article_detail/view/article_detail_screen.dart` (One timestamp): This file sets up the UI and handles state changes for the article detail screen.

`/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/support_portal/test/ui/solution_v2/article_detail/presentation/bloc/article_detail_bloc_test.dart` (Multiple timestamps): This file contains unit tests for the `ArticleDetailBloc`. The changes reflect the updates made to `ArticleDetailBloc`, ensuring that tests cover the changes to error handling and localization.


In summary, the code changes demonstrate a concerted effort to improve the robustness and user experience of the Freshservice support portal's search and article detail features, focusing on comprehensive testing and localized error handling.  The repeated modifications to the test file and localization file between closely spaced timestamps suggest iterative development and debugging.
