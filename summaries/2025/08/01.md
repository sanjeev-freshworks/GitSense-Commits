# Activity Summary for 8/1/2025

## 1:17:26 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/categories/view/channel_test_screen.dart` between 12:31 PM and 12:35 PM on August 1st, 2025.  The core functionality of the `ChannelTestScreen` widget, which receives and displays text via a method channel, remains unchanged.  The primary modifications involve adding logging statements using `FSLogger.logWithTag`.

Initially, attempts were made to directly use `FSLogg` and `FSLogger.lo` (likely typos), before settling on `FSLogger.logWithTag`.  The log tag itself evolved from an empty string, to "ChannelTestScreen", then to "siderfight", "siderfighter", and finally "siderfighter-flutter".

Significant changes occurred around these times:

* **12:31 PM - 12:33 PM:**  Initial logging attempts and correction, including adding the `_tag` constant.
* **12:33 PM:** The `fs_logger` package was imported.
* **12:33 PM - 12:35 PM:**  More detailed logging messages were added within the `setMethodCallHandler` and `build` methods, including the method call's details and the current value of `_text`.
* **12:35 PM:** The final log tag "siderfighter-flutter" was settled upon.

The pattern shows a progressive refinement of logging to provide more context and debug information during the execution of the `ChannelTestScreen`.  The final version includes comprehensive logging at key stages (method call handling and building), enhancing the debugging capabilities of the application.
