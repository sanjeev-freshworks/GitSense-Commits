# Activity Summary for 8/1/2025

## 1:17:26 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution/lib/src/ui/categories/view/channel_test_screen.dart` between 12:31 PM and 12:35 PM on August 1st, 2025.  The core functionality of the `ChannelTestScreen` widget, which receives and displays text via a method channel, remains unchanged.  The primary modifications involve adding logging statements using `FSLogger.logWithTag`.

Initially, attempts were made to directly use `FSLogg` and `FSLogger.lo` (likely typos), before settling on `FSLogger.logWithTag`.  The log tag itself evolved from an empty string, to "ChannelTestScreen", then to "siderfight", "siderfighter", and finally "siderfighter-flutter".

Significant changes occurred around these times:

* **12:31 PM - 12:33 PM:**  Initial logging attempts and correction, including adding the `_tag` constant.
* **12:33 PM:** The `fs_logger` package was imported.
* **12:33 PM - 12:35 PM:**  More detailed logging messages were added within the `setMethodCallHandler` and `build` methods, including the method call's details and the current value of `_text`.
* **12:35 PM:** The final log tag "siderfighter-flutter" was settled upon.

The pattern shows a progressive refinement of logging to provide more context and debug information during the execution of the `ChannelTestScreen`.  The final version includes comprehensive logging at key stages (method call handling and building), enhancing the debugging capabilities of the application.


## 4:17:26 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of two Dart files within the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory.  The primary focus is on the `solution_remote_data_source.dart` file, which underwent three revisions between 3:48:22 PM and 3:48:39 PM on August 1st, 2025.  These revisions appear to involve minor code restructuring and potentially cleaning up imports, with no significant functional changes observed in the code itself.  The imports consistently include packages related to data handling, mapping, and models for solution articles and folders.

The `solution_repository_impl.dart` file was updated once at 3:49:01 PM on August 1st, 2025. This file acts as a repository layer, delegating calls to the `SolutionRemoteDataSource`.  The changes appear to be consistent with the updates to the data source,  ensuring alignment between the repository and the underlying data access layer. There are no functional changes visible.

The `solution_remote_data_source.dart` file consistently defines methods for fetching various solution-related data (categories, folders, articles, details, etc.), each interacting with a remote data source via HTTP requests (`get` method).  The code heavily utilizes mappers for converting between API models and data models.  The slight code re-arrangements in `solution_remote_data_source.dart`  across revisions did not affect the functionality of the code.


## 11:46:24 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/skumar14/workspace/Freshservice/mobile_flutter_freshservice/features/solution` directory, specifically within the routing and UI components.

The initial changes (between 11:19 PM and 11:24 PM) involved defining routes for various solution-related screens (`CategoryListScreen`, `FolderListScreen`, `FolderDetailScreen`) using `go_router` in `solution_routes.dart` and `solution_routes_builder.dart`.  `solution_routes_builder.dart`  was heavily modified during this period, adding routes and correcting a faulty route definition.  The  `SolutionSearchScreenRoute` was added, initially incorrectly using `FolderDetailScreenArgs`, later corrected to use `SolutionSearchScreenArgs` at 11:24:25 PM and finally  its build method correctly returned `SolutionSearchScreen` at 11:24:50 PM.

A `ChannelTestScreen` was introduced, initially without a constructor argument  at 11:19 PM.  It interacts with a method channel (`com.example.channel`) to update its displayed text. The screen was subsequently modified (between 11:25 PM and 11:26 PM) to accept a `query` parameter in its constructor, and at 11:26:09 PM, the `_text` variable was initialized with this query parameter. At 11:27:03 PM this initialization reverted to the "Default text" and the changes are lost.  Finally, at 11:27:52 PM, the `SolutionSearchScreenRoute` was updated to correctly use `ChannelTestScreen`, passing the search query.


The most significant changes occurred in `solution_routes_builder.dart` between 11:22 PM and 11:27 PM, reflecting the iterative development and refinement of the application's routing logic and  handling of search functionality. The `ChannelTestScreen` modifications were incremental adjustments to its functionality and how it receives and displays the search query.
